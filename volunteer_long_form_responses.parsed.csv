Even before this week's declared states of emergencies, Cincinnati Cares saw dramatic declines in its volunteer referrals. The scarcity of volunteers doing what keeps nonprofits in our community humming is readily apparent. And it's a triple whammy. Typically in disaster-related or financial crisis, nonprofits can rely on volunteers to offset donor contribution decreases and service-delivery and event income declines. But not now, due to social-distance warnings. To mobilize volunteers in a way that doesn't put them in harm's way, we're connecting with the more than 750 nonprofits we work with regularly to help them design virtual volunteer opportunities. We're also giving our partners a way through our redesigned site at <http://cincinnaticares.org|cincinnaticares.org> to communicate to the public how COVID-19 has impacted their work -- giving our community a way to see the collective impact of this devastating development, and soon, our region's response. And we're reaching out to the public to let them know they can still help, and we will connect them to volunteering that can be done remotely and online. Stay tuned in with Cincinnati Cares as it works to fill volunteer voids, helps communicate where and how people can help and reveals to the community -- very soon -- how residents all over the region can make an even bigger impact from the comfort and safety of their home or office. Nonprofits wanting to engage volunteers virtually should let us know here: <https://forms.gle/D9x7xB8Sg3ZzUN9B7>.

Iâ€™m a PhD student in Library and Information Science at Western University, supervisor Dr. Kamran Sedig, and my research area is in the use of ontologies for knowledge mobilization (between disciplines and from centres of medical expertise to public) in the context of emerging infectious diseases (comps paper title: Semantic Representation of Complex Health Information: The role of ontologies in non-expert exploration of Emerging Infectious Disease documents) My concerns about COVID-19 are situated in the apparent need for effective public-facing communication as way to facilitate compliance with outbreak response directives (tracking measures like self-reporting/getting tested as well as impact minimizing measures like social-distancing). Particularly the need seems to be for effectively communicating risk and impact in order to help the public make evidence-based decisions regarding their health behaviours during outbreak events. My skills that might be useful: I have a double major in anthropology (cultural and biological) and I am a librarian as well as an early career researcher in Health Informatics and Human-Information Interaction. Subjects I study in my work are information architecture and knowledge organization within organizations, health information behaviour, consumer/patient health vocabularies, cognitive engineering, information overload, decision-support tools, cognitive maps, health information retrieval (aspects such as query formation), semantic search, cross-domain collaboration and factors contributing to outbreak emergence, such as climate change.",Communicating risk and impact to the public so they can make evidence-based decisions during outbreak events.,
