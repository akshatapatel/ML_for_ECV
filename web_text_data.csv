What Happens Next? COVID-19 Futures, Explained With Playable Simulations üïê 30 min play/read ¬∑ by by Marcel Salath√© (epidemiologist) & Nicky Case (art/code)
""The only thing to fear is fear itself"" was stupid advice.
Sure, don't hoard toilet paper ‚Äì but if policymakers fear fear itself, they'll downplay real dangers to avoid ""mass panic"". Fear's not the problem, it's how we channel our fear. Fear gives us energy to deal with dangers now, and prepare for dangers later.
Honestly, we (Marcel, epidemiologist + Nicky, art/code) are worried. We bet you are, too! That's why we've channelled our fear into making these playable simulations, so that you can channel your fear into understanding:
The Last Few Months (epidemiology 101, SEIR model, R & R 0 )
(epidemiology 101, SEIR model, R & R ) The Next Few Months (lockdowns, contact tracing, masks)
(lockdowns, contact tracing, masks) The Next Few Years (loss of immunity? no vaccine?)
This guide (published May 1st, 2020. click this footnote!‚Üí1) is meant to give you hope and fear. To beat COVID-19 in a way that also protects our mental & financial health, we need optimism to create plans, and pessimism to create backup plans. As Gladys Bronwyn Stern once said, ‚ÄúThe optimist invents the airplane and the pessimist the parachute.‚Äù
So, buckle in: we're about to experience some turbulence.
The Last Few Months
Pilots use flight simulators to learn how not to crash planes.
Epidemiologists use epidemic simulators to learn how not to crash humanity.
So, let's make a very, very simple ""epidemic flight simulator""! In this simulation, Infectious people can turn Susceptible people into more Infectious people:
It's estimated that, at the start of a COVID-19 outbreak, the virus jumps from an to an every 4 days, on average.2 (remember, there's a lot of variation)
If we simulate ""double every 4 days"" and nothing else, on a population starting with just 0.001% , what happens?
Click ""Start"" to play the simulation! You can re-play it later with different settings: (technical caveats: 3)
This is the exponential growth curve. Starts small, then explodes. ""Oh it's just a flu"" to ""Oh right, flus don't create mass graves in rich cities"".
But, this simulation is wrong. Exponential growth, thankfully, can't go on forever. One thing that stops a virus from spreading is if others already have the virus:
The more s there are, the faster s become s, but the fewer s there are, the slower s become s.
How's this change the growth of an epidemic? Let's find out:
This is the ""S-shaped"" logistic growth curve. Starts small, explodes, then slows down again.
But, this simulation is still wrong. We're missing the fact that Infectious people eventually stop being infectious, either by 1) recovering, 2) ""recovering"" with lung damage, or 3) dying.
For simplicity's sake, let's pretend that all Infectious people become Recovered. (Just remember that in reality, some are dead.) s can't be infected again, and let's pretend ‚Äì for now! ‚Äì that they stay immune for life.
With COVID-19, it's estimated you're Infectious for 10 days, on average.4 That means some folks will recover before 10 days, some after. Here's what that looks like, with a simulation starting with 100% :
This is the opposite of exponential growth, the exponential decay curve.
Now, what happens if you simulate S-shaped logistic growth with recovery?
Let's find out.
Red curve is current cases ,
Gray curve is total cases (current + recovered ), starts at just 0.001% :
And that's where that famous curve comes from! It's not a bell curve, it's not even a ""log-normal"" curve. It has no name. But you've seen it a zillion times, and beseeched to flatten.
This is the the SIR Model,5
( Susceptible Infectious Recovered)
the second-most important idea in Epidemiology 101:
NOTE: The simulations that inform policy are way, way more sophisticated than this! But the SIR Model can still explain the same general findings, even if missing the nuances.
Actually, let's add one more nuance: before an becomes an , they first become Exposed. This is when they have the virus but can't pass it on yet ‚Äì infected but not yet infectious.
(This variant is called the SEIR Model6, where the ""E"" stands for ""Exposed"". Note this isn't the everyday meaning of ""exposed"", when you may or may not have the virus. In this technical definition, ""Exposed"" means you definitely have it. Science terminology is bad.)
For COVID-19, it's estimated that you're infected-but-not-yet-infectious for 3 days, on average.7 What happens if we add that to the simulation?
Red + Pink curve is current cases (infectious + exposed ),
Gray curve is total cases (current + recovered ):
Not much changes! How long you stay Exposed changes the ratio of -to- , and when current cases peak... but the height of that peak, and total cases in the end, stays the same.
Why's that? Because of the first-most important idea in Epidemiology 101:
Short for ""Reproduction number"". It's the average number of people an infects before they recover (or die).
R changes over the course of an outbreak, as we get more immunity & interventions.
R 0 (pronounced R-nought) is what R is at the start of an outbreak, before immunity or interventions. R 0 more closely reflects the power of the virus itself, but it still changes from place to place. For example, R 0 is higher in dense cities than sparse rural areas.
(Most news articles ‚Äì and even some research papers! ‚Äì confuse R and R 0 . Again, science terminology is bad)
The R 0 for ""the"" seasonal flu is around 1.288. This means, at the start of a flu outbreak, each infects 1.28 others on average. (If it sounds weird that this isn't a whole number, remember that the ""average"" mom has 2.4 children. This doesn't mean there's half-children running about.)
The R 0 for COVID-19 is estimated to be around 2.2,9 though one not-yet-finalized study estimates it was 5.7(!) in Wuhan.10
In our simulations ‚Äì at the start & on average ‚Äì an infects someone every 4 days, over 10 days. ""4 days"" goes into ""10 days"" two-and-a-half times. This means ‚Äì at the start & on average ‚Äì each infects 2.5 others. Therefore, R 0 = 2.5. (caveats:11)
Play with this R 0 calculator, to see how R 0 depends on recovery time & new-infection time:
But remember, the fewer s there are, the slower s become s. The current reproduction number (R) depends not just on the basic reproduction number (R 0 ), but also on how many people are no longer Susceptible. (For example, by recovering & getting natural immunity.)
When enough people have immunity, R < 1, and the virus is contained! This is called herd immunity. For flus, herd immunity is achieved with a vaccine. Trying to achieve ""natural herd immunity"" by letting folks get infected is a terrible idea. (But not for the reason you may think! We'll explain later.)
Now, let's play the SEIR Model again, but showing R 0 , R over time, and the herd immunity threshold:
NOTE: Total cases does not stop at herd immunity, but overshoots it! And it crosses the threshold exactly when current cases peak. (This happens no matter how you change the settings ‚Äì try it for yourself!)
This is because when there are more non- s than the herd immunity threshold, you get R < 1. And when R < 1, new cases stop growing: a peak.
If there's only one lesson you take away from this guide, here it is ‚Äì it's an extremely complex diagram so please take time to fully absorb it:
This means: we do NOT need to catch all transmissions, or even nearly all transmissions, to stop COVID-19!
It's a paradox. COVID-19 is extremely contagious, yet to contain it, we ""only"" need to stop more than 60% of infections. 60%?! If that was a school grade, that's a D-. But if R 0 = 2.5, cutting that by 61% gives us R = 0.975, which is R < 1, virus is contained! (exact formula:12)
(If you think R 0 or the other numbers in our simulations are too low/high, that's good you're challenging our assumptions! There'll be a ""Sandbox Mode"" at the end of this guide, where you can plug in your own numbers, and simulate what happens.)
Every COVID-19 intervention you've heard of ‚Äì handwashing, social/physical distancing, lockdowns, self-isolation, contact tracing & quarantining, face masks, even ""herd immunity"" ‚Äì they're all doing the same thing:
Getting R < 1.
So now, let's use our ""epidemic flight simulator"" to figure this out: How can we get R < 1 in a way that also protects our mental health and financial health?
Brace yourselves for an emergency landing...
The Next Few Months
...could have been worse. Here's a parallel universe we avoided:
Scenario 0: Do Absolutely Nothing
Around 1 in 20 people infected with COVID-19 need to go to an ICU (Intensive Care Unit).13 In a rich country like the USA, there's 1 ICU bed per 3400 people.14 Therefore, the USA can handle 20 out of 3400 people being simultaneously infected ‚Äì or, 0.6% of the population.
Even if we more than tripled that capacity to 2%, here's what would've happened if we did absolutely nothing:
Not good.
That's what the March 16 Imperial College report found: do nothing, and we run out of ICUs, with more than 80% of the population getting infected. (remember: total cases overshoots herd immunity)
Even if only 0.5% of infected die ‚Äì a generous assumption when there's no more ICUs ‚Äì in a large country like the US, with 300 million people, 0.5% of 80% of 300 million = still 1.2 million dead... IF we did nothing.
(Lots of news & social media reported ""80% will be infected"" without ""IF WE DO NOTHING"". Fear was channelled into clicks, not understanding. Sigh.)
Scenario 1: Flatten The Curve / Herd Immunity
The ""Flatten The Curve"" plan was touted by every public health organization, while the United Kingdom's original ""herd immunity"" plan was universally booed. They were the same plan. The UK just communicated theirs poorly.15
Both plans, though, had a literally fatal flaw.
First, let's look at the two main ways to ""flatten the curve"": handwashing & physical distancing.
Increased handwashing cuts flus & colds in high-income countries by ~25%16, while the city-wide lockdown in London cut close contacts by ~70%17. So, let's assume handwashing can reduce R by up to 25%, and distancing can reduce R by up to 70%:
Play with this calculator to see how % of non- , handwashing, and distancing reduce R: (this calculator visualizes their relative effects, which is why increasing one looks like it decreases the effect of the others.18)
Now, let's simulate what happens to a COVID-19 epidemic if, starting March 2020, we had increased handwashing but only mild physical distancing ‚Äì so that R is lower, but still above 1:
Three notes:
This reduces total cases! Even if you don't get R < 1, reducing R still saves lives, by reducing the 'overshoot' above herd immunity. Lots of folks think ""Flatten The Curve"" spreads out cases without reducing the total. This is impossible in any Epidemiology 101 model. But because the news reported ""80%+ will be infected"" as inevitable, folks thought total cases will be the same no matter what. Sigh. Due to the extra interventions, current cases peak before herd immunity is reached. In fact, in this simulation, total cases only overshoots a tiny bit above herd immunity ‚Äì the UK's plan! At that point, R < 1, you can let go of all other interventions, and COVID-19 stays contained! Well, except for one problem... You still run out of ICUs. For several months. (and remember, we already tripled ICUs for these simulations)
That was the other finding of the March 16 Imperial College report, which convinced the UK to abandon its original plan. Any attempt at mitigation (reduce R, but R > 1) will fail. The only way out is suppression (reduce R so that R < 1).
That is, don't merely ""flatten"" the curve, crush the curve. For example, with a...
Scenario 2: Months-Long Lockdown
Let's see what happens if we crush the curve with a 5-month lockdown, reduce to nearly nothing, then finally ‚Äì finally ‚Äì return to normal life:
Oh.
This is the ""second wave"" everyone's talking about. As soon as we remove the lockdown, we get R > 1 again. So, a single leftover (or imported ) can cause a spike in cases that's almost as bad as if we'd done Scenario 0: Absolutely Nothing.
A lockdown isn't a cure, it's just a restart.
So, what, do we just lockdown again & again?
Scenario 3: Intermittent Lockdown
This solution was first suggested by the March 16 Imperial College report, and later again by a Harvard paper.19
Here's a simulation: (After playing the ""recorded scenario"", you can try simulating your own lockdown schedule, by changing the sliders while the simulation is running! Remember you can pause & continue the sim, and change the simulation speed)
This would keep cases below ICU capacity! And it's much better than an 18-month lockdown until a vaccine is available. We just need to... shut down for a few months, open up for a few months, and repeat until a vaccine is available. (And if there's no vaccine, repeat until herd immunity is reached... in 2022.)
Look, it's nice to draw a line saying ""ICU capacity"", but there's lots of important things we can't simulate here. Like:
Mental Health: Loneliness is one of the biggest risk factors for depression, anxiety, and suicide. And it's as associated with an early death as smoking 15 cigarettes a day.20
Financial Health: ""What about the economy"" sounds like you care more about dollars than lives, but ""the economy"" isn't just stocks: it's people's ability to provide food & shelter for their loved ones, to invest in their kids' futures, and enjoy arts, foods, videogames ‚Äì the stuff that makes life worth living. And besides, poverty itself has horrible impacts on mental and physical health.
Not saying we shouldn't lock down again! We'll look at ""circuit breaker"" lockdowns later. Still, it's not ideal.
But wait... haven't Taiwan and South Korea already contained COVID-19? For 4 whole months, without long-term lockdowns?
How?
Scenario 4: Test, Trace, Isolate
""Sure, we *could've* done what Taiwan & South Korea did at the start, but it's too late now. We missed the start.""
But that's exactly it! ‚ÄúA lockdown isn't a cure, it's just a restart‚Äù... and a fresh start is what we need.
To understand how Taiwan & South Korea contained COVID-19, we need to understand the exact timeline of a typical COVID-19 infection21:
If cases only self-isolate when they know they're sick (that is, they feel symptoms), the virus can still spread:
And in fact, 44% of all transmissions are like this: pre-symptomatic! 22
But, if we find and quarantine a symptomatic case's recent close contacts... we stop the spread, by staying one step ahead!
This is called contact tracing. It's an old idea, was used at an unprecedented scale to contain Ebola23, and now it's core part of how Taiwan & South Korea are containing COVID-19!
(It also lets us use our limited tests more efficiently, to find pre-symptomatic s without needing to test almost everyone.)
Traditionally, contacts are found with in-person interviews, but those alone are too slow for COVID-19's ~48 hour window. That's why contact tracers need help, and be supported by ‚Äì NOT replaced by ‚Äì contact tracing apps.
(This idea didn't come from ""techies"": using an app to fight COVID-19 was first proposed by a team of Oxford epidemiologists.)
Wait, apps that trace who you've been in contact with?... Does that mean giving up privacy, giving in to Big Brother?
Heck no! DP-3T, a team of epidemiologists & cryptographers (including one of us, Marcel Salath√©) is already making a contact tracing app ‚Äì with code available to the public ‚Äì that reveals no info about your identity, location, who your contacts are, or even how many contacts you've had.
Here's how it works:
(Here's the full comic. Details about ""pranking""/false positives/etc in footnote:24)
Along with similar teams like TCN Protocol25 and MIT PACT26, they've inspired Apple & Google to bake privacy-first contact tracing directly into Android/iOS.27 (Don't trust Google/Apple? Good! The beauty of this system is it doesn't need trust!) Soon, your local public health agency may ask you to download an app. If it's privacy-first with publicly-available code, please do!
But what about folks without smartphones? Or infections through doorknobs? Or ""true"" asymptomatic cases? Contact tracing apps can't catch all transmissions... and that's okay! We don't need to catch all transmissions, just 60%+ to get R < 1.
(Footnote rant about the confusion between pre-symptomatic vs ""true"" asymptomatic ‚Äì ""true"" asymptomatics are rare:28)
Isolating symptomatic cases would reduce R by up to 40%, and quarantining their pre/a-symptomatic contacts would reduce R by up to 50%29:
Thus, even without 100% contact quarantining, we can get R < 1 without a lockdown! Much better for our mental & financial health. (As for the cost to folks who have to self-isolate/quarantine, governments should support them ‚Äì pay for the tests, job protection, subsidized paid leave, etc. Still way cheaper than intermittent lockdown.)
We then keep R < 1 until we have a vaccine, which turns susceptible s into immune s. Herd immunity, the right way:
(Note: this calculator pretends the vaccines are 100% effective. Just remember that in reality, you'd have to compensate by vaccinating more than ""herd immunity"", to actually get herd immunity)
Okay, enough talk. Here's a simulation of:
A few-month lockdown, until we can... Switch to ""Test, Trace, Isolate"" until we can... Vaccinate enough people, which means... We win.
So that's it! That's how we make an emergency landing on this plane.
That's how we beat COVID-19.
...
But what if things still go wrong? Things have gone horribly wrong already. That's fear, and that's good! Fear gives us energy to create backup plans.
The pessimist invents the parachute.
Scenario 4+: Masks For All, Summer, Circuit Breakers
What if R 0 is way higher than we thought, and the above interventions, even with mild distancing, still aren't enough to get R < 1?
Remember, even if we can't get R < 1, reducing R still reduces the ""overshoot"" in total cases, thus saving lives. But still, R < 1 is the ideal, so here's a few other ways to reduce R:
Masks For All:
""Wait,"" you might ask, ""I thought face masks don't stop you from getting sick?""
You're right. Masks don't stop you from getting sick30... they stop you from getting others sick.
To put a number on it: surgical masks on the infectious person reduce cold & flu viruses in aerosols by 70%.31 Reducing transmissions by 70% would be as large an impact as a lockdown!
However, we don't know for sure the impact of masks on COVID-19 specifically. In science, one should only publish a finding if you're 95% sure of it. (...should.32) Masks, as of May 1st 2020, are less than ""95% sure"".
However, pandemics are like poker. Make bets only when you're 95% sure, and you'll lose everything at stake. As a recent article on masks in the British Medical Journal notes,33 we have to make cost/benefit analyses under uncertainty. Like so:
Cost: If homemade cloth masks (which are ~2/3 as effective as surgical masks34), super cheap. If surgical masks, more expensive but still pretty cheap.
Benefit: Even if it's a 50‚Äì50 chance of surgical masks reducing transmission by 0% or 70%, the average ""expected value"" is still 35%, same as a half-lockdown! So let's guess-timate that surgical masks reduce R by up to 35%, discounted for our uncertainty. (Again, you can challenge our assumptions by turning the sliders up/down)
(other arguments for/against masks:35)
Masks alone won't get R < 1. But if handwashing & ""Test, Trace, Isolate"" only gets us to R = 1.10, having just 1/3 of people wear masks would tip that over to R < 1, virus contained!
Summer:
Okay, this isn't an ""intervention"" we can control, but it will help! Some news outlets report that summer won't do anything to COVID-19. They're half right: summer won't get R < 1, but it will reduce R.
For COVID-19, every extra 1¬∞ Celsius (1.8¬∞ Fahrenheit) makes R drop by 1.2%.36 The summer-winter difference in New York City is 26¬∞C (47¬∞F),37 so summer will make R drop by ~31%.
Summer alone won't make R < 1, but if we have limited resources, we can scale back some interventions in the summer ‚Äì so we can scale them higher in the winter.
A ""Circuit Breaker"" Lockdown:
And if all that still isn't enough to get R < 1... we can do another lockdown.
But we wouldn't have to be 2-months-closed / 1-month-open over & over! Because R is reduced, we'd only need one or two more ""circuit breaker"" lockdowns before a vaccine is available. (Singapore had to do this recently, ""despite"" having controlled COVID-19 for 4 months. That's not failure: this is what success takes.)
Here's a simulation of a ""lazy case"" scenario:
Lockdown, then A moderate amount of hygiene & ""Test, Trace, Isolate"", with a mild amount of ""Masks For All"", then... One more ""circuit breaker"" lockdown before a vaccine's found.
Not to mention all the other interventions we could do, to further push R down:
Travel restrictions/quarantines
Temperature checks at malls & schools
Deep-cleaning public spaces
Replacing hand-shaking with foot-bumping
And all else human ingenuity shall bring
. . .
We hope these plans give you hope.
Even under a pessimistic scenario, it is possible to beat COVID-19, while protecting our mental and financial health. Use the lockdown as a ""reset button"", keep R < 1 with case isolation + privacy-protecting contact tracing + at least cloth masks for all... and life can get back to a normal-ish!
Sure, you may have dried-out hands. But you'll get to invite a date out to a comics bookstore! You'll get to go out with friends to watch the latest Hollywood cash-grab. You'll get to people-watch at a library, taking joy in people going about the simple business of being alive.
Even under the worst-case scenario... life perseveres.
So now, let's plan for some worse worst-case scenarios. Water landing, get your life jacket, and please follow the lights to the emergency exits:
The Next Few Years
You get COVID-19, and recover. Or you get the COVID-19 vaccine. Either way, you're now immune...
...for how long?
COVID-19 is most closely related to SARS, which gave its survivors 2 years of immunity. 38
The coronaviruses that cause ""the"" common cold give you 8 months of immunity. 39
There's reports of folks recovering from COVID-19, then testing positive again, but it's unclear if these are false positives. 40
One not-yet-peer-reviewed study on monkeys showed immunity to the COVID-19 coronavirus for at least 28 days.41
But for COVID-19 in humans, as of May 1st 2020, ""how long"" is the big unknown.
For these simulations, let's say it's 1 year. Here's a simulation starting with 100% , exponentially decaying into susceptible, no-immunity s after 1 year, on average, with variation:
Return of the exponential decay!
This is the SEIRS Model. The final ""S"" stands for Susceptible, again.
Now, let's simulate a COVID-19 outbreak, over 10 years, with no interventions... if immunity only lasts a year:
In previous simulations, we only had one ICU-overwhelming spike. Now, we have several, and cases come to a rest permanently at ICU capacity. (Which, remember, we tripled for these simulations)
R = 1, it's endemic.
Thankfully, because summer reduces R, it'll make the situation better:
Oh.
Counterintuitively, summer makes the spikes worse and regular! This is because summer reduces new s, but that in turn reduces new immune s. Which means immunity plummets in the summer, creating large regular spikes in the winter.
Thankfully, the solution to this is pretty straightforward ‚Äì just vaccinate people every fall/winter, like we do with flu shots:
(After playing the recording, try simulating your own vaccination campaigns! Remember you can pause/continue the sim at any time)
But here's the scarier question:
What if there's no vaccine for years? Or ever?
To be clear: this is unlikely. Most epidemiologists expect a vaccine in 1 to 2 years. Sure, there's never been a vaccine for any of the other coronaviruses before, but that's because SARS was eradicated quickly, and ""the"" common cold wasn't worth the investment.
Still, infectious disease researchers have expressed worries: What if we can't make enough?42 What if we rush it, and it's not safe?43
Even in the nightmare ""no-vaccine"" scenario, we still have 3 ways out. From most to least terrible:
1) Do intermittent or loose R < 1 interventions, to reach ""natural herd immunity"". (Warning: this will result in many deaths & damaged lungs. And won't work if immunity doesn't last.)
2) Do the R < 1 interventions forever. Contact tracing & wearing masks just becomes a new norm in the post-COVID-19 world, like how STI tests & wearing condoms became a new norm in the post-HIV world.
3) Do the R < 1 interventions until we develop treatments that make COVID-19 way, way less likely to need critical care. (Which we should be doing anyway!) Reducing ICU use by 10x is the same as increasing our ICU capacity by 10x:
Here's a simulation of no lasting immunity, no vaccine, and not even any interventions ‚Äì just slowly increasing capacity to survive the long-term spikes:
Even under the worst worst-case scenario... life perseveres.
. . .
Maybe you'd like to challenge our assumptions, and try different R 0 's or numbers. Or try simulating your own combination of intervention plans!
Here's an (optional) Sandbox Mode, with everything available. (scroll to see all controls) Simulate & play around to your heart's content:
This basic ""epidemic flight simulator"" has taught us so much. It's let us answer questions about the past few months, next few months, and next few years.
So finally, let's return to...
The Now
Plane's sunk. We've scrambled onto the life rafts. It's time to find dry land.44
Teams of epidemiologists and policymakers (left, right, and multi-partisan) have come to a consensus on how to beat COVID-19, while protecting our lives and liberties.
Here's the rough idea, with some (less-consensus) backup plans:
So what does this mean for YOU, right now?
For everyone: Respect the lockdown so we can get out of Phase I asap. Keep washing those hands. Make your own masks. Download a privacy-protecting contact tracing app when those are available next month. Stay healthy, physically & mentally! And write your local policymaker to get off their butt and...
For policymakers: Make laws to support folks who have to self-isolate/quarantine. Hire more manual contact tracers, supported by privacy-protecting contact tracing apps. Direct more funds into the stuff we should be building, like...
For builders: Build tests. Build ventilators. Build personal protective equipment for hospitals. Build tests. Build masks. Build apps. Build antivirals, prophylactics, and other treatments that aren't vaccines. Build vaccines. Build tests. Build tests. Build tests. Build hope.
Don't downplay fear to build up hope. Our fear should team up with our hope, like the inventors of airplanes & parachutes. Preparing for horrible futures is how we create a hopeful future.
The only thing to fear is the idea that the only thing to fear is fear itself.",[],

Using the gating criteria provided by the White House , we've tracked each state's progress towards its reduction in symptoms and cases, health system readiness, and increased test capacity.
Where Is My State on the Road to Recovery
What Data Is Missing?
Unfortunately, we cannot track how states are deploying contact tracing programs because that data is not reported yet. We also lack data sources for how states are implementing safe quarantine spaces. Once that data is available, we'll incorporate it.
Using sources like the COVID Tracking Project and the CDC we are able to start measure how a state is controlling the epidemic. Some sources are more ""real-time"" like case data , but others can lag a week like influenza-like illness (ILI) data . For the moment, this is the best representation of how a state is doing based on publicly available information.Unfortunately, we cannot track how states are deploying contact tracing programs because that data is not reported yet. We also lack data sources for how states are implementing safe quarantine spaces. Once that data is available, we'll incorporate it.
How Are States Progressing on Reopening?
Using a simple red , yellow , green scale, you can see the progress towards achieving the gating criteria.
How is the Disease Spreading?
What's critical is a downward trajectory of illness reported and documented cases.
Can Our Health System Handle the Spread?
Bed and ICU availability, case fatality rate, and cases per capita are a proxy for load on our hospitals.
How Is My State Doing On Testing?
We track our country's daily progress towards two goals: reaching 500K tests per day and 4 million tests per day. The targets for each state have been adjusted per capita.

[Please note: a follow-up analysis is now available here .]
Imperial finally released a derivative of Ferguson‚Äôs code. I figured I‚Äôd do a review of it and send you some of the things I noticed. I don‚Äôt know your background so apologies if some of this is pitched at the wrong level.
My background. I have been writing software for 30 years. I worked at Google between 2006 and 2014, where I was a senior software engineer working on Maps, Gmail and account security. I spent the last five years at a US/UK firm where I designed the company‚Äôs database product, amongst other jobs and projects. I was also an independent consultant for a couple of years. Obviously I‚Äôm giving only my own professional opinion and not speaking for my current employer.
The code. It isn‚Äôt the code Ferguson ran to produce his famous Report 9. What‚Äôs been released on GitHub is a heavily modified derivative of it, after having been upgraded for over a month by a team from Microsoft and others. This revised codebase is split into multiple files for legibility and written in C++, whereas the original program was ‚Äúa single 15,000 line file that had been worked on for a decade‚Äù (this is considered extremely poor practice). A request for the original code was made 8 days ago but ignored, and it will probably take some kind of legal compulsion to make them release it. Clearly, Imperial are too embarrassed by the state of it ever to release it of their own free will, which is unacceptable given that it was paid for by the taxpayer and belongs to them.
The model. What it‚Äôs doing is best described as ‚ÄúSimCity without the graphics‚Äù. It attempts to simulate households, schools, offices, people and their movements, etc. I won‚Äôt go further into the underlying assumptions, since that‚Äôs well explored elsewhere.
Non-deterministic outputs. Due to bugs, the code can produce very different results given identical inputs. They routinely act as if this is unimportant.
This problem makes the code unusable for scientific purposes, given that a key part of the scientific method is the ability to replicate results. Without replication, the findings might not be real at all ‚Äì as the field of psychology has been finding out to its cost. Even if their original code was released, it‚Äôs apparent that the same numbers as in Report 9 might not come out of it.
Non-deterministic outputs may take some explanation, as it‚Äôs not something anyone previously floated as a possibility.
The documentation says:
The model is stochastic. Multiple runs with different seeds should be undertaken to see average behaviour.
‚ÄúStochastic‚Äù is just a scientific-sounding word for ‚Äúrandom‚Äù. That‚Äôs not a problem if the randomness is intentional pseudo-randomness, i.e. the randomness is derived from a starting ‚Äúseed‚Äù which is iterated to produce the random numbers. Such randomness is often used in Monte Carlo techniques. It‚Äôs safe because the seed can be recorded and the same (pseudo-)random numbers produced from it in future. Any kid who‚Äôs played Minecraft is familiar with pseudo-randomness because Minecraft gives you the seeds it uses to generate the random worlds, so by sharing seeds you can share worlds.
Clearly, the documentation wants us to think that, given a starting seed, the model will always produce the same results.
Investigation reveals the truth: the code produces critically different results, even for identical starting seeds and parameters.
I‚Äôll illustrate with a few bugs. In issue 116 a UK ‚Äúred team‚Äù at Edinburgh University reports that they tried to use a mode that stores data tables in a more efficient format for faster loading, and discovered ‚Äì to their surprise ‚Äì that the resulting predictions varied by around 80,000 deaths after 80 days:
That mode doesn‚Äôt change anything about the world being simulated, so this was obviously a bug.
The Imperial team‚Äôs response is that it doesn‚Äôt matter: they are ‚Äúaware of some small non-determinisms‚Äù, but ‚Äúthis has historically been considered acceptable because of the general stochastic nature of the model‚Äù. Note the phrasing here: Imperial know their code has such bugs, but act as if it‚Äôs some inherent randomness of the universe, rather than a result of amateur coding. Apparently, in epidemiology, a difference of 80,000 deaths is ‚Äúa small non-determinism‚Äù.
Imperial advised Edinburgh that the problem goes away if you run the model in single-threaded mode, like they do. This means they suggest using only a single CPU core rather than the many cores that any video game would successfully use. For a simulation of a country, using only a single CPU core is obviously a dire problem ‚Äì as far from supercomputing as you can get. Nonetheless, that‚Äôs how Imperial use the code: they know it breaks when they try to run it faster. It‚Äôs clear from reading the code that in 2014 Imperial tried to make the code use multiple CPUs to speed it up, but never made it work reliably. This sort of programming is known to be difficult and usually requires senior, experienced engineers to get good results. Results that randomly change from run to run are a common consequence of thread-safety bugs. More colloquially, these are known as ‚ÄúHeisenbugs‚Äú.
But Edinburgh came back and reported that ‚Äì even in single-threaded mode ‚Äì they still see the problem. So Imperial‚Äôs understanding of the issue is wrong. Finally, Imperial admit there‚Äôs a bug by referencing a code change they‚Äôve made that fixes it. The explanation given is ‚ÄúIt looks like historically the second pair of seeds had been used at this point, to make the runs identical regardless of how the network was made, but that this had been changed when seed-resetting was implemented‚Äù. In other words, in the process of changing the model they made it non-replicable and never noticed.
Why didn‚Äôt they notice? Because their code is so deeply riddled with similar bugs and they struggled so much to fix them that they got into the habit of simply averaging the results of multiple runs to cover it up‚Ä¶ and eventually this behaviour became normalised within the team.
In issue #30, someone reports that the model produces different outputs depending on what kind of computer it‚Äôs run on (regardless of the number of CPUs). Again, the explanation is that although this new problem ‚Äúwill just add to the issues‚Äù ‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt a problem running the model in full as it is stochastic anyway‚Äù.
Although the academic on those threads isn‚Äôt Neil Ferguson, he is well aware that the code is filled with bugs that create random results. In change #107 he authored he comments: ‚ÄúIt includes fixes to InitModel to ensure deterministic runs with holidays enabled‚Äù. In change #158 he describes the change only as ‚ÄúA lot of small changes, some critical to determinacy‚Äù.
Imperial are trying to have their cake and eat it. Reports of random results are dismissed with responses like ‚Äúthat‚Äôs not a problem, just run it a lot of times and take the average‚Äù, but at the same time, they‚Äôre fixing such bugs when they find them. They know their code can‚Äôt withstand scrutiny, so they hid it until professionals had a chance to fix it, but the damage from over a decade of amateur hobby programming is so extensive that even Microsoft were unable to make it run right.
No tests. In the discussion of the fix for the first bug, Imperial state the code used to be deterministic in that place but they broke it without noticing when changing the code.
Regressions like that are common when working on a complex piece of software, which is why industrial software-engineering teams write automated regression tests. These are programs that run the program with varying inputs and then check the outputs are what‚Äôs expected. Every proposed change is run against every test and if any tests fail, the change may not be made.
The Imperial code doesn‚Äôt seem to have working regression tests. They tried, but the extent of the random behaviour in their code left them defeated. On 4th April they said: ‚ÄúHowever, we haven‚Äôt had the time to work out a scalable and maintainable way of running the regression test in a way that allows a small amount of variation, but doesn‚Äôt let the figures drift over time.‚Äù
Beyond the apparently unsalvageable nature of this specific codebase, testing model predictions faces a fundamental problem, in that the authors don‚Äôt know what the ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù answer is until long after the fact, and by then the code has changed again anyway, thus changing the set of bugs in it. So it‚Äôs unclear what regression tests really mean for models like this ‚Äì even if they had some that worked.
Undocumented equations. Much of the code consists of formulas for which no purpose is given. John Carmack (a legendary video-game programmer) surmised that some of the code might have been automatically translated from FORTRAN some years ago.
For example, on line 510 of SetupModel.cpp there is a loop over all the ‚Äúplaces‚Äù the simulation knows about. This code appears to be trying to calculate R0 for ‚Äúplaces‚Äù. Hotels are excluded during this pass, without explanation.
This bit of code highlights an issue Caswell Bligh has discussed in your site‚Äôs comments: R0 isn‚Äôt a real characteristic of the virus. R0 is both an input to and an output of these models, and is routinely adjusted for different environments and situations. Models that consume their own outputs as inputs is problem well known to the private sector ‚Äì it can lead to rapid divergence and incorrect prediction. There‚Äôs a discussion of this problem in section 2.2 of the Google paper, ‚ÄúMachine learning: the high interest credit card of technical debt‚Äú.
Continuing development. Despite being aware of the severe problems in their code that they ‚Äúhaven‚Äôt had time‚Äù to fix, the Imperial team continue to add new features; for instance, the model attempts to simulate the impact of digital contact tracing apps.
Adding new features to a codebase with this many quality problems will just compound them and make them worse. If I saw this in a company I was consulting for I‚Äôd immediately advise them to halt new feature development until thorough regression testing was in place and code quality had been improved.
Conclusions. All papers based on this code should be retracted immediately. Imperial‚Äôs modelling efforts should be reset with a new team that isn‚Äôt under Professor Ferguson, and which has a commitment to replicable results with published code from day one.
On a personal level, I‚Äôd go further and suggest that all academic epidemiology be defunded. This sort of work is best done by the insurance sector. Insurers employ modellers and data scientists, but also employ managers whose job is to decide whether a model is accurate enough for real world usage and professional software engineers to ensure model software is properly tested, understandable and so on. Academic efforts don‚Äôt have these people, and the results speak for themselves.
My identity. Sue Denim isn‚Äôt a real person (read it out). I‚Äôve chosen to remain anonymous partly because of the intense fighting that surrounds lockdown, but there‚Äôs also a deeper reason. This situation has come about due to rampant credentialism and I‚Äôm tired of it. As the widespread dismay by programmers demonstrates, if anyone in SAGE or the Government had shown the code to a working software engineer they happened to know, alarm bells would have been rung immediately. Instead, the Government is dominated by academics who apparently felt unable to question anything done by a fellow professor. Meanwhile, average citizens like myself are told we should never question ‚Äúexpertise‚Äù. Although I‚Äôve proven my Google employment to Toby, this mentality is damaging and needs to end: please, evaluate the claims I‚Äôve made for yourself, or ask a programmer you know and trust to evaluate them for you.","['Bob Hope', 'Tom Welsh', 'Mike Whittaker', 'Jonathan Gilmore', 'Tim Bidie', ""P.

The initial dataset
The CTP began in spreadsheets, and we‚Äôre rolling out the first data release for the COVID Racial Data Tracker in the same way.
Racial data tracker dataset (beta release‚Äîweb version, CSV) : We‚Äôve compiled the racial and ethnic data that states are reporting for several COVID-19 data categories so that other researchers can begin to work with, analyze, and visualize this information. This is a challenging dataset to compile and code, and our data sources remain in flux, but we offer this beta release for full transparency. We appreciate your feedback at racial.data@covidtracking.com as we work toward building a complete dataset and getting it into our API and onto the website.

So much racial data is still missing
While many states are starting to release racial data, very few release comprehensive data. We‚Äôre advocating to change that, and you can, too. We built our state reporting completeness tracker for internal use to calculate our new state data quality grades, but you can also use this sheet to learn which states report which kinds of data until we have a simpler, public-facing system.

This project began when Ibram X. Kendi, the executive director of the Antiracist Research & Policy Center, wrote a series of essays in The Atlantic about the urgent need to gather demographic information to understand the outbreak and protect vulnerable communities. The federal government‚Äôs failure to assemble this data has left it to us to produce this resource for journalists, researchers, advocates, and the public.

SARS-CoV-2 Genealogy Through the Lens of Gain-of-Function Research,"Staff celebrating the physical completion of the laboratory in 2015, Wuhan, China (Source)
If you hear anyone claim ‚Äúwe know the virus didn‚Äôt come from a lab‚Äù, don‚Äôt buy it ‚Äî it may well have. Labs around the globe have been creating synthetic viruses like CoV2 for years. And no, its genome would not necessarily contain hallmarks of human manipulation: modern genetic engineering tools permit cutting and pasting genomic fragments without leaving a trace. It can be done quickly, too: it took a Swiss team less than a month to create a synthetic clone of CoV2.
How I Learned to Start Worrying
Oh, come on. Lab-made? Nonsense! Back in January, that was my knee-jerk reaction when ideas that Covid-19 is caused by a laboratory leak had just surfaced. Bioweapon? Well, that is just Flat Earth crazies territory. Thus, whenever I kept hearing anything about non-natural origins of SARS-CoV-2, I brushed it aside under similar sentiments. So what if there is a virology institute in Wuhan? Who knows how many of those are sprinkled throughout China.
At some point, it became necessary to brush such theories aside in a substantiated manner, as their proponents began to back up their theses about the possible artificial nature of the virus with arguments from molecular biology, and when engaging them in debate, I wanted to smash their conspiracy theories with cold, hard scientific facts. Just like that Nature paper (or so I thought).
So it was then, in pursuit of arguments against the virus‚Äôs lab-madeness, that I got infected by the virus of doubt. What was the source of my doubts? The fact that the deeper you dive into the research activities of coronavirologists over the past 15‚Äì20 years, the more you realize that creating chimeras like CoV2 was commonplace in their labs. And CoV2 is an obvious chimera (though not nesessarily a lab-made one), which is based on the ancestral bat strain RaTG13, in which the receptor binding motif (RBM) in its spike protein is replaced by the RBM from a pangolin strain, and in addition, a small but very special stretch of 4 amino acids is inserted, which creates a furin cleavage site that, as virologists have previously established, significantly expands the ‚Äúrepertoire‚Äù of the virus in terms of whose cells it can penetrate. Most likely, it was thanks to this new furin site that the new mutant managed to jump species from its original host to humans.
Indeed, virologists, including the leader of coronavirus research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, Shi Zhengli, have done many similar things in the past ‚Äî both replacing the RBM in one type of virus by an RBM from another, or adding a new furin site that can provide a species-specific coronavirus with an ability to start using the same receptor (e.g. ACE2) in other species. In fact, Shi Zhengli‚Äôs group was creating chimeric constructs as far back as 2007 and as recently as 2017, when they created a whole of 8 new chimeric coronaviruses with various RBMs. In 2019 such work was in full swing, as WIV was part of a $3.7 million NIH grant titled Understanding the Risk of Bat Coronavirus Emergence. Under its auspices, Shi Zhengli co-authored a 2019 paper that called for continued research into synthetic viruses and testing them in vitro and in vivo:
Currently, no clinical treatments or prevention strategies are available for any human coronavirus. Given the conserved RBDs of SARS-CoV and bat SARSr-CoVs, some anti-SARS-CoV strategies in development, such as anti-RBD antibodies or RBD-based vaccines, should be tested against bat SARSr-CoVs. Recent studies demonstrated that anti-SARS-CoV strategies worked against only WIV1 and not SHC014. In addition, little information is available on HKU3-related strains that have much wider geographical distribution and bear truncations in their RBD. Similarly, anti-S antibodies against MERS-CoV could not protect from infection with a pseudovirus bearing the bat MERSr-CoV S. Furthermore, little is known about the replication and pathogenesis of these bat viruses. Thus, future work should be focused on the biological properties of these viruses using virus isolation, reverse genetics and in vitro and in vivo infection assays. The resulting data would help the prevention and control of emerging SARS-like or MERS-like diseases in the future.
If the above quote might seem vague as to what exactly ‚Äúusing reverse genetics‚Äù might mean, the NIH grant itself spells it out:
Aim 3. In vitro and in vivo characterization of SARSr-CoV spillover risk, coupled with spatial and phylogenetic analyses to identify the regions and viruses of public health concern. We will use S protein sequence data, infectious clone technology, in vitro and in vivo infection experiments and analysis of receptor binding to test the hypothesis that % divergence thresholds in S protein sequences predict spillover potential.
‚ÄúInfectious clone technology‚Äù stands for creating live synthetic viral clones. Considering the heights of user friendliness and automation that genetic engineering tools have attained, creating a synthetic CoV2 via the above methodology would be in reach of even a grad student.
But before delving into CoV2 origins, let‚Äôs first take a quick dive into its biology.
Biology
Ok, let‚Äôs start from the basics. What‚Äôs a furin site, an RBM, or a spike protein? Bear with me: once you wade through the jungle of terminology, conceptually, everything is pretty straightforward. For example, spike proteins are those red things sticking out of a virus particle ‚Äî the very reason for which these viruses got ‚Äúcrowned‚Äù:
It is with the help of these proteins that the virion clings to the receptor of the victim cell (ACE2 in our case) to then penetrate inside. So it is a vitally important part of the virus, as without getting into a cell viruses cannot replicate. The spike protein also determines which animals the virus can or cannot infect, as ACE2 receptors (or other targets for other viruses) in different species can differ in structure. At the same time, out of the entire 30 kilobase genome (quite huge by viral standards), the gene of this protein makes up only 12‚Äì13%. So the spike protein is only about 1300 amino acids long. Below is how the spike (S) protein is structured in CoV2 and close relatives:
As can be seen from the figure above, the S protein consists of two subunits: S1 and S2. It is S1 that interacts with the ACE2 receptor, and the place where S1 does so is called Receptor Binding Domain (RBD), while the area of direct contact, the holy of holies, is called Receptor Binding Motif (RBM). Here is a beautiful illustration from an equally beautiful work:

When the CoV2 genome was just sequenced and made publicly available on January 10, 2020, it was a riddle, as no closely related strains were known. But quite quickly, on January 23, Shi Zhengli released a paper indicating that CoV2 is 96% identical to RaTG13, a strain which her laboratory had previously isolated from Yunnan bats in 2013. However, outside of her lab, no one knew about that strain until January 2020.
It was immediately clear that RaTG13 is special. Take a look at the figure below:
This is a genome similarity graph between CoV2 and other known strains. The higher the curve, the higher the percentage of matching nucleotides. As you can see, in the spike protein (S) gene region (between nucleotides 22k and 25k), only RaTG13 is more or less close to CoV2, while all other strains take a deep dive around this spot ‚Äî both strains from other bats and the first SARS-CoV (red curve). This in itself is far from suspicious ‚Äî who knows how many unknown SARS-like strains lurk in the bat caves of Yunnan? Ok, maybe it is not very clear how exactly the virus could get from there to Wuhan, but hey, with those wet markets you never know.
Pangolins
Next, pangolins appeared on the scene: in February, another group of Chinese scientists discovered a peculiar strain of pangolin coronavirus in their possession, which, while generally being only 90% similar to CoV2, in the RBM region was almost identical to it, with only a single amino acid difference (see the upper two sequences, dots indicate a match with the top sequence):
Surprisingly, in the first quarter of the S protein, the pangolin strain is highly dissimilar from CoV2, but after the RBM all three strains (CoV2, Pangolin, RaTG13) exhibit a shared high degree of similarity. Most strikingly, RaTG13‚Äôs RBM itself is quite different than that of CoV2, which can be seen from the steep dive of the green RaTG13 graph compared to the red CoV2 graph in the RBM region (pink strip) in the following graph:
This observation is confirmed by the phylogenetic analysis of the three areas highlighted in the graph above ‚Äî in the RBM, the pangolin strain is closer to CoV2 than is RaTG13, but it is RaTG13 that is closer to CoV2 to the left and right of RBM. So there is obvious recombination, as the authors (and other papers) conclude.
How did the researchers obtain those pangolins? This is how:
They were confiscated from smugglers by Chinese customs and transferred to an animal rehab center in Guangdong, where they died while exhibiting severe coronavirus symptoms. This, of course, must have gotten the attention of local virologists, who took several samples:
Pangolins used in the study were confiscated by Customs and Department of Forestry of Guangdong Province in March-December 2019. They include four Chinese pangolins (Manis pentadactyla) and 25 Malayan pangolins (Manis javanica). These animals were sent to the wildlife rescue center, and were mostly inactive and sobbing, and eventually died in custody despite exhausting rescue efforts. Tissue samples were taken from the lung, lymph nodes, liver, spleen, muscle, kidney, and other tissues from pangolins that had just died for histopathological and virological examinations.
Those pangolins attracted the attention of other virologists too. For example, a team in Hong Kong also received samples of confiscated pangolins and in February 2020 they also released a paper that noted clear signs of recombination in the CoV2 spike protein:
We received frozen tissue (lungs, intestine, blood) samples that were collected from 18 Malayan pangolins (Manis javanica) during August 2017-January 2018. These pangolins were obtained during the anti-smuggling operations by Guangxi Customs. Strikingly, high-throughput sequencing of their RNA revealed the presence of coronaviruses in six (two lung, two intestine, one lung-intestine mix, one blood) of 43 samples. With the sequence read data, and by filling gaps with amplicon sequencing, we were able to obtain six full or nearly full genome sequences ‚Äî denoted GX/P1E, GX/P2V, GX/P3B, GX/P4L, GX/P5E and GX/P5L ‚Äî that fall into the 2019-CoV2 lineage (within the genus Betacoronavirus) in a phylogenetic analysis (Figure 1a).
‚Ä¶
More notable, however, was the observation of putative recombination signals between the pangolins coronaviruses, bat coronaviruses RaTG13, and human 2019-CoV2 (Figure 1c, d). In particular, 2019-CoV2 exhibits very high sequence similarity to the Guangdong pangolin coronaviruses in the receptor-binding domain (RBD; 97.4% amino acid similarity; indicated by red arrow in Figure 1c and Figure 2a), even though it is most closely related to bat coronavirus RaTG13 in the remainder of the viral genome. Bat CoV RaTG and the human 2019-CoV2 have only 89.2% amino acid similarity in RBD. Indeed, the Guangdong pangolin coronaviruses and 2019-CoV2 possess identical amino acids at the five critical residues of the RBD, whereas RaTG13 only shares one amino acid with 2019-CoV2 (residue 442, human SARS-CoV numbering).
By the way, the authors of this article also highlighted the high phylogenetic mosaicity of the CoV2 spike protein:
Interestingly, a phylogenetic analysis of synonymous sites alone in the RBD revealed that the phylogenetic position of the Guangdong pangolin is consistent with that in the remainder of the viral genome, rather than being the closest relative of 2019-CoV2 (Figure 2b). Hence, it is possible that the amino acid similarity between the RBD of the Guangdong pangolin coronaviruses and 2019-CoV2 is due to selectively-mediated convergent evolution rather than recombination, although it is difficult to choose between these scenarios on current data.
Translated from science-speak, what this means is that if we analyze the entire RBD of the three strains, ignoring the obvious differences (i.e. non-synonymous substitutions) among them, which are mainly found in the RBM (which, recall, is identical between CoV2 and Pangolin), and construct a phylogenetic tree for synonymous substitutions, CoV2 is still closer to RaTG13 than to the pangolin strain. Which is rather strange in light of the fact that the pangolin strain and CoV2 have identical RBMs (which are segments inside RBD).
The authors go on to put forth a conjecture that this may be the result of convergent evolution, in other words, that CoV2 and the pangolin strain came to possess identical RBMs each in their own way, rather than through recombination between common ancestors. Because it would have required a rather unique recombination event ‚Äî as if someone cut out a precise RBM segment from a pangolin strain and used it to replace the RBM in RaTG13. Talk about Intelligent Design!
Royal Genealogy
In order to better understand CoV2 origins, let‚Äôs take a look at spike protein sequences of our Unholy Trinity: CoV2, RaTG13 and MP789 (pangolin-2019). Let‚Äôs compare the pairwise differences between them (identical amino acids are marked with dots, red letters denote differences, and dashes indicate deleted/inserted amino acids):
The comparisons illustrate what previously quoted papers have noted: that in the first quarter of the sequence, the pangolin strain is far from CoV2 and RaTG1, and if it weren‚Äôt for the RBM region (red rectangle), RaTG13 would have been very close to CoV2. But, as I already said, the RBM in CoV2 is closest to that of the pangolin strain.
What about other pangolin strains? So far we‚Äôve only analyzed the MP789 strain isolated from pangolins confiscated by customs in 2019. But there was another batch of pangolins confiscated in 2017, and they also had a similar coronavirus strain isolated. Let‚Äôs compare it to RaTG13 and MP789:
In the first quarter of the S protein, the 2017 pangolin strains are closer to RaTG13 (and CoV2) than their 2019 pangolin counterpart (MP789). At the same time, all three have a clear recent common ancestor in the areas marked by green rectangles, and in these areas RaTG13 and pangolin-2019 (MP789) are closer to each other than to pangolin-2017, since they have several common mutations (marked by red and blue ellipses), which are absent from pangolin-2017. But the RBM for all three is different, and different in approximately the same proportion, and in similar places.
Maybe after ancestors of RaTG13 and MP789 diverged, the MP789 ancestor had the first quarter of its protein replaced (which did not occur in RaTG13 or pangolin-2017), and the rest of the protein remained common for all three strains. Later the paths of the RaTG13 and MP789 gene pools crossed again and produced CoV2. It is also possible that the ancestor of RaTG13 arose as a result of recombination of ancestral pangolin strains.
It is also interesting to see a rather unique identical mutation (QTQTNS) in RaTG13 and pangolin-2019 right in front of the spot where CoV2 has a new furin cleavage site. That furin site, as I mentioned, arose via an insertion of 4 new amino acids (PRRA). If we look at the nucleotide sequence around this insertion, we can see that RaTG13 and CoV2 are closer to each other in that area than to pangolin-2019, since they possess several common mutations (highlighted in blue):
By the way, Orf1ab is also a phylogenetic mess in CoV2: 1a is closer to RaTG13, but 1b is closer to pangolin-2019:
Does this mean that the ancestor of CoV2 crossed with the common ancestor of pangolin-19 at least twice? First, when it (along with a common ancestor of RaTG13) inherited Orf1ab and the second half of the spike protein with the QTQTNS mutation, and second time when it acquired 1b and RBM, which differ from RaTG13. All of this is certainly possible in nature ‚Äî after all, these viruses mutate and recombine constantly. Another question is where exactly bat and pangolin viruses are most likely to encounter one another for such orgies ‚Äî in mountain caves, ‚Äúwet markets‚Äù, shelters for confiscated animals, or even in laboratories. But let‚Äôs put those questions aside for now. First, let discuss what is arguably the most eye-catching aspect of the new virus ‚Äî a 4-amino acid insertion that turned it into a natural-born killer.
A Killer Intro
It is impossible to ignore the introduction of a PRRA insert between S1 and S2: it sticks out like a splinter. This insert creates the furin cleavage site, which I mentioned at the very beginning. Let me explain what a furin site is. Remember the structure of our spike protein? Here is a detailed diagram:
The protein consists of two parts, S1 and S2, of which S1 is responsible for primary contact with the receptor (recall Receptor Binding Domain / Motif), and S2 is responsible for fusion with the cell membrane and penetration into the cell. The fusion process is started by the fusion peptide marked in yellow, but in order for it to engage in its dirty deed, someone must cut the S protein at one of the sites marked by diamonds in the diagram above. The virus does not have its own such ‚Äúcutters‚Äù, so it relies on various proteases of its victims. There are several types of such proteases, as can be deduced from the abundance of colors of those diamonds. But not all proteases are equal, and not all types of cells have proteases needed by the virus. Furin is one of the most effective, and it is found not only on the surface of cells, but also inside. Most clearly, the danger of the new furin site is demonstrated by the difference between CoV2 and its grandpa, SARS-CoV:
As can be seen from the diagram, in the case of CoV2, thanks to the furin site, it is not two, but three classes of proteases (three colored PacMans) that can cut its S protein outside the cell. But perhaps the most important difference is that furin is also present inside the cell, so it can cut the S protein immediately after virion assembly, thereby providing new virions with the ability to merge with new cells right off the bat (no pun intended).
The importance of the new furin site in CoV2‚Äôs virulence was recently demonstrated by a study in hamsters where the disappearance of the furin site (due to a mutation) greatly decreased mutant CoV2‚Äôs pathogenicity and replication ability:
Infection of hamsters shows that one of the variants (Del-mut-1) which carries deletion of 10 amino acids (30 bp) does not cause the body weight loss or more severe pathological changes in the lungs that is associated with wild type virus infection.
Virus replication in the lung tissues of hamsters infected with either WT or Del-mut-1 SARS-CoV-2 virus. Virus titration by plaque assay of lung and tracheal tissues collected on day 2 and 4 post-infection
The good news is that there already exist various furin and other protease inhibitors, and some of them (like camostat and its analogs) are already being clinically tested against CoV2.
By the way, it is possible that the new furin site could also be largely responsible for the pronounced age-dependent morbidity and mortality of CoV2:
Patients with hypertension, diabetes, coronary heart disease, cerebrovascular illness, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and kidney dysfunction have worse clinical outcomes when infected with SARS-CoV-2, for unknown reasons. The purpose of this review is to summarize the evidence for the existence of elevated plasmin(ogen) in COVID-19 patients with these comorbid conditions. Plasmin, and other proteases, may cleave a newly inserted furin site in the S protein of SARS-CoV-2, extracellularly, which increases its infectivity and virulence.
Furin cuts proteins in strictly defined places, namely after an RxxR sequence (that is, Arg-X-X-Arg, where X can be any amino acid). Moreover, if arginine is also in the second or third place (that is, RRxR or RxRR), then the cleavage efficiency is significantly increased.
Therefore, the appearance of a new furin cleavage site was noticed immediately, as none of the closest or even distant relatives of Cov2 have such a site ‚Äî those coronaviruses that do, share only 40% of their genome with Cov2:
It was found that all Spike with a SARS-CoV-2 Spike sequence homology greater than 40% did not have a furin cleavage site (Figure 1, Table 1), including Bat-CoV RaTG13 and SARS-CoV (with sequence identity as 97.4% and 78.6%, respectively). The furin cleavage site ‚ÄúRRAR‚Äù in SARS-CoV-2 is unique in its family, rendering by its unique insert of ‚ÄúPRRA‚Äù. The furin cleavage site of SARS-CoV-2 is unlikely to have evolved from MERS, HCoV-HKU1, and so on. From the currently available sequences in databases, it is difficult for us to find the source. Perhaps there are still many evolutionary intermediate sequences waiting to be discovered.
Here is a great illustration from the source article of the quote above. Coronaviruses with a furin site are marked in pink, 3 different strains of Cov2 are shown at 10 o‚Äôclock:
The closest relative with a furin site is the HKU5 strain, isolated by the Shi Zhengli team in 2014 in Guangzhou from bats of the genus Pipistrellus (added to GenBank in 2018). But it is a very distant relative ‚Äî their spike proteins share only 36%.
So the virologists are puzzled. Where did this 12 nucleotide insert come from? Could it be lab-made? Well, virologists have studied furin sites in coronaviruses for decades, and have introduced many artificial ones in a lab. For example, an American team had inserted RRSRR into the spike protein of the first SARS-CoV back in 2006:
To investigate whether proteolytic cleavage at the basic amino acid residues, were it to occur, might facilitate cell‚Äìcell fusion activity, we mutated the wild-type SARS-CoV glycoprotein to construct a prototypic furin recognition site (RRSRR) at either position.
And the Japanese have inserted a similar site (RRKR) into the SARS-CoV protein in 2008, though a bit downstream than in CoV2:
In the same year 2008, their Dutch colleagues also studied these protease sites of SARS-CoV and compared them to the murine coronavirus MHV, which also has such a site (SRRAHR | SV), one that is quite similar to the site of CoV2 (SPRRAR | SV):
In 2009, another American group also worked on ‚Äúimproving‚Äù SARS-CoV and, continuing the American tradition of not penny-pinching on arginines, they inserted as many as 4 of them (RRSRR):
To examine the potential use of the SARS-CoV S1‚ÄìS2 and S2‚Ä≤ positions as sites for proteolytic cleavage, we first introduced furin cleavage recognition sites at these locations by making the following mutations 664-SLLRSTSQSI ‚Äî SLLRRSRRSI-671 (S1‚ÄìS2) and 792-LKPTKRSF ‚Äî LKRTKRSF-799 (S2‚Ä≤).
Beijing 2019
But the most recent work of this kind that I came across was an October 2019 paper from several Beijing labs, where the new furin site RRKR was inserted into not just some pseudovirus, but into an actual live chicken coronavirus, infectious bronchitis virus (IBV):
An interesting side note is that, as the authors point out, the addition of a furin site allows the mutant virus to infect nerve cells. Perhaps the CoV2 furin site is the reason why some patients with CoV2 exhibit neurological symptoms, including loss of smell:
Mutation of the S2' site of QX genotype (QX-type) spike protein (S) in a recombinant virus background results in higher pathogenicity, pronounced neural symptoms and neurotropism when compared with conditions in wild-type IBV (WT-IBV) infected chickens. In this study, we present evidence suggesting that recombinant IBV with a mutant S2' site (furin-S2' site) leads to higher mortality. Infection with mutant IBV induces severe encephalitis and breaks the blood‚Äìbrain barrier.
‚Ä¶
In summary, our results demonstrate that the furin cleavage site upstream of the FP in S protein is an important site for CoV, modulating entry, cell‚Äìvirus fusion, adaptation to its host cell, cell tropism and pathogenicity, but not antigenicity.
To be clear, many coronaviruses have naturally occurring furin sites, and they are very diverse. Obviously, they can appear as a result of random mutations. This is what happened in the case of MERS, as was pointed out in 2015 by an international team of authors, including Shi Zhengli and Ralph Baric, two stars of synthetic coronavirusology. We will come back to them many times, but for now, a few words about that article. In it the authors have shown that just two mutations allowed MERS to jump from bats to humans, and one of these mutations created a furin site. Though it was not an insertion of new amino acids, but a mutation of an existing one (marked in red on the left below):
The authors did not just show this, but actually introduced these mutations back into the original bat strain: they created the same furin site and showed that it enables the bat strain to infect human cells:
To evaluate the potential genetic changes required for HKU4 to infect human cells, we reengineered HKU4 spike, aiming to build its capacity to mediate viral entry into human cells. To this end, we introduced two single mutations, S746R and N762A, into HKU4 spike. The S746R mutation was expected to restore the hPPC motif in HKU4 spike, whereas the N762A mutation likely disrupted the potential N-linked glycosylation site in the hECP motif in HKU4 spike.
‚Ä¶
We examined the capability of the mutant HKU4 spike to mediate viral entry into three types of human cells (Fig. 3A for HEK293T cells; data not shown for Huh-7 and MRC-5 cells), using a pseudovirus entry assay as previously described (14). In the absence of exogenous protease trypsin, HKU4 pseudoviruses bearing either the reengineered hPPC motif or the reengineered hECP motif were able to enter human cells, whereas HKU4 pseudoviruses bearing both of the reengineered human protease motifs entered human cells as efficiently as when activated by exogenous trypsin (Fig. 3A). In contrast, wild-type HKU4 pseudoviruses failed to enter human cells. Therefore, the reengineered hPPC and hECP motifs enabled HKU4 spike to be activated by human endogenous proteases and thereby allowed HKU4 pseudoviruses to bypass the need for exogenous proteases to enter human cells. These results reveal that HKU4 spike needs only two single mutations at the S1/S2 boundary to gain the full capacity to mediate viral entry into human cells.
By the way, how they did it might frighten those who aren‚Äôt familiar with modern biotechnology ‚Äî because the authors inserted this coronavirus spike-like protein into inactivated HIV:
Briefly, MERS-CoV-spike-pseudotyped retroviruses expressing a luciferase reporter gene were prepared by cotransfecting HEK293T cells with a plasmid carrying Env-defective, luciferase-expressing HIV-1 genome (pNL4‚Äì3.luc.R-E-) and a plasmid encoding MERS-CoV spike protein.
Perhaps this is what prompted Indian researchers to look for sequences similar to HIV in the CoV2 genome (but their preprint was quickly criticized for bad methodology and erroneous conclusions). In fact, experts use such pseudoviruses regularly, and in general, one should not be scared of retroviruses as a class ‚Äî their subspecies lentiviruses have been used for gene therapy for many years.
Where Did RaTG13 Come From?
RaTG13 is a very unusual strain. Odd to see that Shi Zhengli‚Äôs group was silent about it for all these years. After all, it is very different from its SARS-like siblings, especially in the spike protein, which is precisely what determines which types of cells (and in which animals) this virus can infect. Here is a genome similarity graph of CoV2 compared to other bat coronaviruses (panel B):
The red curve represents RaTG13 while the blue curve is for the strains closest to RaTG13 (ZXC21 and ZC45). These strains were isolated from Chinese horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus sinicus) in Zhoushan in 2015 (ZXC21) and 2017 (ZC45). As can be seen from the above graph, even they differ in their S proteins from RaTG13. A direct sequence comparison illustrates this difference best:
As we can see, the spike proteins of ZXC21 and ZC45 are not only 23‚Äì24 amino acid residues shorter than the RaTG13 protein, but they are shorter in the most important place ‚Äî in the RBM (note the deletions in the red box marked with red dashes).
So where did RaTG13 come from? As I already mentioned, in 2020 Shi Zhengli reported that she isolated it in 2013 from Yunnan horseshoe bats (from Rhinolophus affinis, not the usual suspects R. sinicus). But until January 2020, this strain‚Äôs existence was not known, and here is how Shi Zhengli‚Äôs group described their discovery about RaTG13‚Äôs similarity to CoV2:
We then found that a short region of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) from a bat coronavirus (BatCoV RaTG13) ‚Äî which was previously detected in Rhinolophus affinis from Yunnan province ‚Äî showed high sequence identity to 2019-CoV2. We carried out full-length sequencing on this RNA sample (GISAID accession number EPI_ISL_402131). Simplot analysis showed that 2019-CoV2 was highly similar throughout the genome to RaTG13 (Fig. 1c), with an overall genome sequence identity of 96.2%.
Not much detail: previously detected, and that is that. Moreover, the quote seems to imply that until 2020, they only sequenced a part of its genome, the RdRp gene (which is part of Orf1b that precedes the spike protein gene). Ok, but where exactly in Yunnan was it obtained? The paper doesn‚Äôt mention it, and neither does GenBank. However, the GISAID entry seems to have a bit more info: collected in Pu‚Äôer City from a male bat‚Äôs fecal swab:
This rang a bell, as in my wanderings around Pubmed, I had already encountered an expedition to Pu‚Äôer in the summer of 2013:
Bats were captured from various locations in five counties of four prefectures of Yunnan Province, China, from May to July 2013.
Researchers did not report anything particularly interesting for us from that expedition, but maybe it was then that Shi Zhengli or someone from her group obtained the RaTG13 sample? Which they sequenced only partially, and for some reason decided not to publish, although it was very different from everything known before.
By the way, Shi Zhengli could well have personally participated in that expedition, as she expressed great fondness when describing them ‚Äî for example, in her TED-like talk in 2018, where she showed personal photos from such expeditions:
Moreover, it was a series of exactly such expeditions that brought Shi Zhengli worldwide fame and a ‚ÄúBatwoman‚Äù moniker: in a 2013 Nature paper, her group triumphantly announced that in Yunnan caves they had discovered carrier bats of the RsSHC014 and Rs3367 strains that coincided with the first SARS-CoV by 85% and 96%, respectively.
It is quite a coincidence that around the same time in Yunnan, Shi Zhengli‚Äôs group also discovered RaTG13, the closest strain to CoV2, and the two also share 96% of their genomes.
UPD: Is RaTG13 the same as RaBtCoV/4991?
[UPDATED] After I had published this post, I was pointed to this preprint that alleges that RaTG13 is, in fact, RaBtCoV/4991 (KP876546), which Shi Zhengli had previously reported discovering in an abandoned mineshaft in Yunnan in 2013. There indeed are several reasons to think so. First and foremost, the only published sequence for RaBtCoV/4991 is 100% identical to that of RaTG13 at the nucleotide level, albeit being just a 370-bp stretch of the RdRp gene:
Second, the collection details of the two strains are nearly identical: both were collected in July 2013 from a fecal swab of R. affinis bats:
RaBtCoV/4991 was collected in a mineshaft located in the Mojiang county, which is under the jurisdiction of Pu‚Äôer City:
Mojiang Hani Autonomous County is an autonomous county under the jurisdiction of Pu‚Äôer City, in the south of Yunnan Province, China.
Wikipedia
And Pu‚Äôer City is listed as the collection location of RaTG13 at the GISAID database, which could well be an approximation for the Mojiang mineshaft.
It is odd that in her 2020 paper on RaTG13 Shi Zhengli fails to mention RaBtCoV/4991 or cite her 2016 paper about its discovery, for which she is listed as the one who ‚Äúdesigned and coordinated the study‚Äù. It is not like RaBtCoV/4991 was forgotten by her group, as it is mentioned in their 2019 paper, where it is included in a phylogenetic tree of other coronaviruses:
I doubt that RaBtCoV/4991‚Äôs place in that tree was determined based solely on a 370-bp fragment, so I would think that by early 2019, Shi Zhengli‚Äôs group would have sequenced its full genome.
Intriguingly, both pangolin-2017 and pangolin-2019 genomes are also very close in this stretch of the RdRp gene, and CoV2 and pangolin-2019 share a few common mutations not found in RaTG13:
But let‚Äôs put this topic aside for now and get back to the story of Shi Zhengli‚Äôs famous 2013 Nature paper.
‚ÄúWuhan-1‚Äù
In that paper, Shi Zhengli‚Äôs group also reported that by culturing the isolated samples in monkey Vero cells, they managed to isolate a live virus that was almost identical to the Rs3367 strain. The authors named their creation WIV1 (where WIV stands for Wuhan Institute of Virology):
Most importantly, we report the first recorded isolation of a live SL-CoV (bat SL-CoV-WIV1) from bat faecal samples in Vero E6 cells, which has typical coronavirus morphology, 99.9% sequence identity to Rs3367 and uses ACE2 from humans, civets and Chinese horseshoe bats for cell entry. Preliminary in vitro testing indicates that WIV1 also has a broad species tropism.
Let‚Äôs compare RaTG13 with Rs3367 and RsSHC014:
As we can see, the spike proteins of these strains are not only 13 amino acids shorter than that of RaTG13, but they also differ in the first quarter of the protein quite substantially. By the way, it is curious that the spike proteins of Rs3367 (aka WIV1) and RsSCH014 are almost identical, and differ only in the RBD region (right sequence below). Almost like CoV2 and RaTG13 (not counting the furin insert):
Could researchers, having received coronavirus samples from pangolins that were intercepted by customs in March 2019, then want to check whether the RBM in pangolin strains can bind to the human ACE2 receptor? And could such researchers also decide to throw an extra furin site in the mix?
Theoretically, of course, they could. From a technical standpoint, it is almost routine for virologists to conduct such experiments. A reasonable question might be: why use RaTG13 as a backbone, and not, say, the tried and true WIV1? Well, it doesn‚Äôt have to be either-or: maybe a chimera with WIV1 was also tested. But in parallel, they might have decided to simulate recombination of the pangolin virus with the bat strain closest to it ‚Äî after all, RaTG13 is much closer to the pangolin strains than WIV1: its spike protein is closer to them both phylogenetically and structurally ‚Äî it even matches them in length, while the proteins of WIV1/Rs3367 and RsSHC014 are 13 amino acids shorter. Also, the QTQTNS mutation common to RaTG13 and pangolin-2019 (MP789) just before the protease site could not have gone unnoticed by coronavirus experts.
Other Yunnan Strains
In 2011, other researchers had also found samples of coronaviruses from the Yunnan Rhinolophus affinis. The strain LYRa11 seemed to me the most interesting:
But it is also quite distant from RaTG13, and much closer to Rs3367 (that‚Äôs the strain that shares 96% with the first SARS-CoV):
But RaTG13, isolated from the same Rhinolophus affinis bats as LYRa11, looks the least like it (left sequence comparison).
Finally, another Yunnan strain (ingenuously named Yunnan2011), isolated in 2011 from another subspecies of horseshoe bats, Rhinolophus pusillus, is even less similar to RaTG13 than LYRa11:
Between themselves, Yunnan2011 and LYRa11 (the right sequence above) are not particularly similar, apart from the highly conserved S2 region. By the way, what‚Äôs up with the differing naming conventions for these strains? Sometimes they fully spell out the year, sometimes partially, yet other times not at all (Rs3367). The carrier species sometimes leads (RaTG13), sometimes follows (LYRa11). And what do TG, LY or SHC stand for? Initials of the person sequencing the genome?
Anyways, let‚Äôs move on from viral archeology to viral engineering, namely transplanting key areas of the spike protein between species and other gain-of-function (GOF) experiments.
1999: First Chimeric Coronavirus
If you think that all of the gain-of-function coronavirus research into what exactly allows coronaviruses to jump from one species to another began in response to the first SARS outbreak in 2002, you‚Äôd be mistaken. Virologists experimented with chimeric coronaviruses long before that. Here, for example, is a 1999 paper from the Dutch group of Peter Rottier from Utrecht University with a revealing title Retargeting of Coronavirus by Substitution of the Spike Glycoprotein Ectodomain: Crossing the Host Cell Species Barrier:
Using targeted RNA recombination, we constructed a mutant of the coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) in which the ectodomain of the spike glycoprotein (S) was replaced with the highly divergent ectodomain of the S protein of feline infectious peritonitis virus. The resulting chimeric virus, designated fMHV, acquired the ability to infect feline cells and simultaneously lost the ability to infect murine cells in tissue culture.
By the way, Shi Zhengli seems to have worked under the supervision of Peter Rottier in Utrecht for a time. At least in 2005, she co-authored a joint paper where Utrecht was listed as her affiliation (but her current address was listed at Shanghai Institute). That article itself is quite curious ‚Äî in it the authors investigated what exactly allows viruses to expand their species tropism:
Only a relatively few mutations in its spike protein allow the murine coronavirus to switch from a murine-restricted tropism to an extended host range by being passaged in vitro. One such virus that we studied had acquired two putative heparan sulfate-binding sites while preserving another site in the furin-cleavage motif. The adaptation of the virus through the use of heparan sulfate as an attachment/entry receptor was demonstrated by increased heparin binding as well as by inhibition of infection through treatment of cells and the virus with heparinase and heparin, respectively.
It is interesting that the furin site in that virus (SRRAHR | SV) is similar to the site in CoV2 (SPRRAR | SV), although in CoV2 it is cut more efficiently due to dual arginines (this is what makes it a polybasic site, i.e. it has multiple basic amino acids in a row in the RxxR sequence):
But what is especially curious is that the mutations that allowed the virus to ‚Äúexpand its horizons‚Äù occurred not in animals, but in vitro. Moreover, it seems, they happened pretty quickly:
MHV/pi23, a virus obtained after 23 of the 600 passages that resulted in MHV/BHK, also contains a putative HS-binding site in the S1 domain at the same position as in MHV/BHK, albeit as a smaller insertion, while it lacks the putative HS-binding site immediately upstream of the fusion peptide. MHV/pi23 does infect nonmurine cells to some extent but much less efficiently than MHV/BHK. In addition to the multiple HS-binding sites, however, mutations found in other parts of the S protein, such as the HR1 domain and the putative fusion peptide (Fig. 1), might also contribute to the efficient entry into nonmurine cells. We are currently in the process of determining the S protein mutations that are required for the extended host range phenotype.
Skipping ahead, I‚Äôll just mention that there were other groups that used in vitro mutagenesis to increase the virulence of coronaviruses, for example, MERS:
To better understand the species adaptability of MERS-CoV, we identified a suboptimal species-derived variant of DPP4 to study viral adaption. Passaging virus on cells expressing this DPP4 variant led to accumulation of mutations in the viral spike which increased replication.
Moreover, their mutations arose after just several passages (rounds of cell culture reproduction):
(F) Schematic of single and double mutation emergence in MERS-CoV spike over different passages.
(G) Location of mutations within MERS-CoV spike.
But those experiments occurred much later. In the meantime, let‚Äôs go back to 2002 ‚Äî BEFORE the outbreak of the first SARS-CoV.
Ralph ‚ÄúTrailblazer‚Äù Baric
Ralph Baric is a legend in coronavirology. He is a trailblazer of synthetic genomic manipulation techniques. Back in 2002, he published a breakthrough work, which marked a milestone in both the study of various mechanisms of natural viruses and in gain-of-function research. In their paper, the Baric group described creating a synthetic clone of a natural murine coronavirus:
A novel method was developed to assemble a full-length infectious cDNA of the group II coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus strain A59 (MHV-A59). Seven contiguous cDNA clones that spanned the 31.5-kb MHV genome were isolated. The ends of the cDNAs were engineered with unique junctions and assembled with only the adjacent cDNA subclones, resulting in an intact MHV-A59 cDNA construct of ‚àº31.5 kb in length. The interconnecting restriction site junctions that are located at the ends of each cDNA are systematically removed during the assembly of the complete full-length cDNA product, allowing reassembly without the introduction of nucleotide changes‚Ä¶ The method has the potential to be used to construct viral, microbial, or eukaryotic genomes approaching several million base pairs in length and used to insert restriction sites at any given nucleotide in a microbial genome.
In essense, the authors have ‚Äútranslated‚Äù the RNA virus into the language of DNA (using reverse transcriptase), which enabled them to manipulate its genome with the help of existing genetic engineering tools. Having created 7 such cDNA provirus segments, the authors then stitched them together ‚Äúseamlessly‚Äù (i.e. without introducing any new, even silent mutations, including new restrictase sites), after which they transcribed their construct back into RNA, which was then translated into virus particles in other cells.
SARS-2003
Just a few weeks after the publication of the above work, the first SARS-CoV epidemic broke out. The Baric group sprang into action. By summer of 2003, they have submitted a paper on synthetically recreating SARS-CoV:
Using a panel of contiguous cDNAs that span the entire genome, we have assembled a full-length cDNA of the SARS-CoV Urbani strain, and have rescued molecularly cloned SARS viruses (infectious clone SARS-CoV) that contained the expected marker mutations inserted into the component clones. Recombinant viruses replicated as efficiently as WT virus and both were inhibited by treatment with the cysteine proteinase inhibitor‚Ä¶ Availability of a SARS-CoV full-length cDNA provides a template for manipulation of the viral genome, allowing for the rapid and rational development and testing of candidate vaccines and therapeutics against this important human pathogen.
The speed of the Baric group illustrates how quickly a qualified team of virologists can create a synthetic clone from a natural virus, and therefore make genetic modifications to it. Moreover, that was back in 2003. Today, a qualified laboratory can repeat those steps in a matter of weeks.
In fact, two just did: the Swiss have created a synthetic clone of CoV2 in under a month, while it took the Galveston BSL4 lab less than 2 months to do so.
SARS-2006
Baric was the first, but far from the last. Genetic engineering developed by leaps and bounds, creating newer and better tools. Other groups explored alternative synthetic virology techniques. For example, in 2006, Spanish researchers followed in Baric‚Äôs footsteps, also creating a synthetic SARS clone, but using an alternative approach (bacterial artificial chromosome):
The engineering of a full-length infectious cDNA clone and a functional replicon of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) Urbani strain as bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs) is described in this study. In this system, the viral RNA was expressed in the cell nucleus under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter and further amplified in the cytoplasm by the viral replicase. Both the infectious clone and the replicon were fully stable in Escherichia coli.
‚Ä¶
The assembled SARS-CoV infectious cDNA clone was fully stable during its propagation in E. coli DH10B cells for more than 200 generations, considerably facilitating the genetic manipulation of the viral genome (data not shown). The detailed cloning strategy, plasmid maps, and sequences are available upon request.
Strategy to assemble a SARS-CoV infectious cDNA clone as a BAC.
(A) Genetic structure of the SARS-CoV Urbani strain genome. Relevant restriction sites used for the assembly of the full-length cDNA clone are indicated. Numbers in parentheses indicate the genomic positions of the first nucleotide of the restriction endonuclease recognition sequence. Letters and numbers indicate the viral genes. L, leader sequence; UTR, untranslated region; An, poly(A) tail. (B) Construction of pBAC-SARS-CoV 5‚Ä≤-3‚Ä≤. After the selection of appropriate restriction sites, the intermediate plasmid pBAC-SARS-CoV 5‚Ä≤-3‚Ä≤ was constructed as the backbone for assembling the infectious cDNA clone. This plasmid includes the first 681 nt of the genome under the control of the CMV promoter, a multiple-cloning site containing the restriction sites selected for the final assembly of the infectious clone, and the last 975 nt of the genome, followed by a synthetic poly(A) tail (pA), the hepatitis delta virus ribozyme (Rz), and the bovine growth hormone termination and polyadenylation sequences (BGH). All these elements were precisely joined by overlapping PCR. The CMV promoter transcription start and the ribozyme cleavage site are shown. ¬© Schematic diagram showing the five-step cloning strategy used for the assembly of the SARS-CoV full-length cDNA clone. The five overlapping cDNA fragments, named SARS 1 to SARS 5, were sequentially cloned into the plasmid pBAC-SARS-CoV 5‚Ä≤-3‚Ä≤ to generate the plasmid pBAC-SARS-CoVFL. Relevant restriction sites are indicated. The labels are as described for panel A.
True, they didn‚Äôt do it as elegantly as Baric, as their final assembly of the synthetic virus included their added restriction enzyme sites, while Baric learned to combine fragments ‚Äúseamlessly‚Äù. But this is a minor point, the Spanish approach is just as robust ‚Äî in 2013, with its help, the same authors had created a synthetic clone of MERS, and in 2015 their technique was included in a coronavirus textbook (chapter 13).
Wuhan 2007
Let‚Äôs get back to 2007. That is when the Shi Zhengli group joined the synthetic virology race with a study of the spike protein of human and bat coronaviruses, trying to determine what exactly is responsible for the ability to skip from one species to another:
A series of S chimeras was constructed by inserting different sequences of the SARS-CoV S into the SL-CoV S backbone.
That is, the authors inserted different segments from the human SARS-CoV spike protein into the spike protein of the bat virus. Here is their conclusion:
From these results, it was deduced that the region from aa 310 to 518 of BJ01-S was necessary and sufficient to convert Rp3-S into a huACE2-binding molecule.
At the same time, they tried to replace shorter fragments, including just the RBM:
For introduction of the RBM of SARS-CoV S into the SL-CoV S, the coding region from aa 424 to 494 of BJ01-S was used to replace the corresponding regions of Rp3-S, resulting in a chimeric S (CS) gene designated CS424‚Äì494.
Given that the above was written in 2007, I think today it will not be difficult for even a novice virologist to replace the RBM of one virus by an RBM from another.
Chimera-2015
In light of the above experiments, it is not very clear what caused the uproar that followed probably the most famous gain-of-function virology paper. I am referring to the joint 2015 work of Shi Zhengli and Ralph Baric, in which they created a synthetic chimeric virus:
Using the SARS-CoV reverse genetics system, we generated and characterized a chimeric virus expressing the spike of bat coronavirus SHC014 in a mouse-adapted SARS-CoV backbone. The results indicate that group 2b viruses encoding the SHC014 spike in a wild-type backbone can efficiently use multiple orthologs of the SARS receptor human angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2), replicate efficiently in primary human airway cells and achieve in vitro titers equivalent to epidemic strains of SARS-CoV. Additionally, in vivo experiments demonstrate replication of the chimeric virus in mouse lung with notable pathogenesis. Evaluation of available SARS-based immune-therapeutic and prophylactic modalities revealed poor efficacy; both monoclonal antibody and vaccine approaches failed to neutralize and protect from infection with CoVs using the novel spike protein. On the basis of these findings, we synthetically re-derived an infectious full-length SHC014 recombinant virus and demonstrate robust viral replication both in vitro and in vivo.
To me, the authors followed a familiar path: they took the spike-like protein from RsSHC014, which Shi Zhengli isolated from Yunnan bats in 2011, and inserted it into a murine-adapted variant of SARS-CoV for subsequent in vivo experiments. They also tested it in human cells, and almost as an aside created a recombinant clone of the same RsSHC014 strain:
(a) Schematic of the SHC014-CoV molecular clone, which was synthesized as six contiguous cDNAs (designated SHC014A, SHC014B, SHC014C, SHC014D, SHC014E and SHC014F) flanked by unique BglI sites that allowed for directed assembly of the full-length cDNA expressing open reading frames (for 1a, 1b, spike, 3, envelope, matrix, 6‚Äì8 and nucleocapsid). Underlined nucleotides represent the overhang sequences formed after restriction enzyme cleavage.
The researchers also uncovered that it was not only the binding of spike protein to the receptor that determined the virus‚Äôs potential for transition from one animal species to another, because the SHC014-MA15 chimera was more virulent than SHC014 itself, even in human cells:
Notably, differential tropism in the lung as compared to that with SARS-MA15 and attenuation of full-length SHC014-CoV in [human epithelial airway cell] cultures relative to SARS-CoV Urbani suggest that factors beyond ACE2 binding ‚Äî including spike processivity, receptor bio-availability or antagonism of the host immune responses ‚Äî may contribute to emergence.
I especially want to highlight the spike processivity in the quote, because this is not the first time that virologists have mentioned that the ability of a spike protein to be cleaved by proteases (including furin) can have an impact on virulence.
That‚Äôs all I have to say about that paper. As a curiosity here is a common photo of its key authors, which was taken in Wuhan, in October 2018. Fittingly, Ralph Bari—Å and Shi Zhengli are front and center. I call this photo ‚ÄúThe Wuhan Clan‚Äù. (Sorry, couldn‚Äôt resist).
Murine SARS-2007
One quick aside regarding the ‚Äúmurine virus MA15‚Äù from the above paper. That was not some kind of natural murine coronavirus, as one might think. It was a laboratory-modified human SARS-CoV, which back in 2007 the Baric group ‚Äî possibly in competition with the Shi Zhengli group (remember their article from 2007) ‚Äî turned into a real beast. To do this, they first iteratively ‚Äúimproved‚Äù it in mice, and when after several iterations it became maximally ‚Äúeffective‚Äù, they reproduced the observed mutations in a synthetic clone, and once again checked that it really does have increased virulence and lethality:
We adapted the SARS-CoV (Urbani strain) by serial passage in the respiratory tract of young BALB/c mice. Fifteen passages resulted in a virus (MA15) that is lethal for mice following intranasal inoculation. Lethality is preceded by rapid and high titer viral replication in lungs, viremia, and dissemination of virus to extrapulmonary sites accompanied by lymphopenia, neutrophilia, and pathological changes in the lungs. Abundant viral antigen is extensively distributed in bronchial epithelial cells and alveolar pneumocytes, and necrotic cellular debris is present in airways and alveoli, with only mild and focal pneumonitis. These observations suggest that mice infected with MA15 die from an overwhelming viral infection with extensive, virally mediated destruction of pneumocytes and ciliated epithelial cells. The MA15 virus has six coding mutations associated with adaptation and increased virulence; when introduced into a recombinant SARS-CoV, these mutations result in a highly virulent and lethal virus (rMA15), duplicating the phenotype of the biologically derived MA15 virus. Intranasal inoculation with MA15 reproduces many aspects of disease seen in severe human cases of SARS.
Baric-2008
Here is another example of the potential scientific rivalry between the Baric and Shi Zhengli groups. In 2008, the Baric group took the Bat-SCoV strain and replaced its RBD with an RBD from human SARS. That is, they essentially reproduced the work of Shi Zhengli‚Äôs group from 2007, except they didn‚Äôt limit themselves to pseudo-viruses, but created a real chimeric virus:
Here, we report the design, synthesis, and recovery of the largest synthetic replicating life form, a 29.7-kb bat severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronavirus (Bat-SCoV), a likely progenitor to the SARS-CoV epidemic.
‚Ä¶
To test whether the RBDs of Bat-SCoV and SARS-CoV were interchangeable, we replaced the Bat-SCoV RBD (amino acid 323‚Äì505) with the SARS-CoV RBD (amino acid 319‚Äì518) (27, 28) (GenBank accession no. FJ211860), simulating a theoretical recombination event that might occur during mixed infection in vivo (Fig. 1B).
(B) Schematic representation showing organization of the SARS-CoV and Bat-SCoV Spike proteins. The engineered Spike proteins are pictured below with the virus name to the left. Bat-SRBD includes all of the Bat-SCoV Spike sequence except that the Bat-SCoV RBD (Bat-SCoV amino acid 323‚Äì505) is replaced with the SARS-CoV RBD (amino acid 319‚Äì518) (GenBank accession no. FJ211860). Bat-SRBD-MA includes the MA15 Spike RBD change at SARS-CoV aa Y436H. Bat-SRBM includes the minimal 13 SARS-CoV residues critical for ACE2 contact, resulting in a chimeric RBD of Bat-SCoV amino acid 323I-429T and SARS-CoV amino acid 426R-518D. Bat-Hinge is Bat-SRBM sequence, with Bat-SCoV amino acid 392L-397E replaced with SARS-CoV amino acid 388V-393D. Bat-F includes nt 1‚Äì24057 of SARS-CoV (to Spike amino acid 855), with the remaining 3‚Ä≤ sequence from Bat-SCoV. To the right of the schematic representations, observation of transcript activity and approximate stock titers at passage 1 (P1) are indicated. ND indicates no infectious virus detected by plaque assay.
Baric-2016
The Baric group does seem to have its share of similar papers. For example, in 2016, they essentially repeated their collaboration with Shi Zhengli from 2015 to create a chimeric virus, only this time they inserted a spike protein segment into their mouse-adapted SARS not from RsSCH014, but from another strain Shi Zhengli found in Yunnan ‚Äî its close relative Rs3367. Or, to be exact, from WIV1 ‚Äî the laboratory clone of Rs3367 isolated at the Wuhan Institute of Virology in 2013:
Using the SARS-CoV infectious clone as a template (7), we designed and synthesized a full-length infectious clone of WIV1-CoV consisting of six plasmids that could be enzymatically cut, ligated together, and electroporated into cells to rescue replication competent progeny virions (Fig. S1A). In addition to the full-length clone, we also produced WIV1-CoV chimeric virus that replaced the SARS spike with the WIV1 spike within the mouse-adapted backbone (WIV1-MA15, Fig. S1B). ‚Ä¶ To confirm growth kinetics and replication, Vero cells were infected with SARS-CoV Urbani, WIV1-MA15, and WIV1-CoV.
To me, the 2016 paper looks a lot like the 2015 one. Moreover, its rationale is not very clear to me: after all, WIV1/Rs3367 already shared 96% of their genome with SARS-CoV. So I am not sure why one would want to insert a spike protein from its closest relative back into SARS-CoV. Maybe just because they could. In this light, the title of the article acquires a certain duality: SARS-like WIV1-CoV poised for human emergence.
Oh, and I am not sure how in 2015 Baric was granted a patent for the creation of ‚Äúchimeric coronavirus spike proteins‚Äù, given all that he and Shi Zhengli previously disclosed in their papers long before 2015.
Baric-1990
Just so you appreciate how long Ralph Baric has been at this game ‚Äî he was designing recombinant coronaviruses way before there were any DNA sequencing machines or other modern tools of genetic engineering. Here is his paper on the creation of ‚Äútemperature mutants‚Äù from mouse coronavirus from 1990:
The A59 strain of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV-A59) was used throughout the course of this study. Virus was propagated and cloned three times in the continuous murine astrocytoma cell line (DBT).
‚Ä¶
Various combinations of [temperature sensitive] mutants were mixed and inoculated onto cells at a multiplicity of infection of 10 each.
So Dr. Baric has been creating mutant viruses for over 30 years.
Wuhan-2017
The Shi Zhengli group has also not been idle since the famous 2015 paper. In 2017, they published a paper where they reported creating not one but 8 chimeric viruses ‚Äî all made using transplanted RBDs from bat SARS-like viruses which they collected over a span of 5 years from the very cave around Kunming, Yunnan Province, where Shi Zhengli originally found Rs3367 and RsSCH014.
Using the reverse genetics technique we previously developed for WIV1 [23], we constructed a group of infectious bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clones with the backbone of WIV1 and variants of S genes from 8 different bat SARSr-CoVs. Only the infectious clones for Rs4231 and Rs7327 led to cytopathic effects in Vero E6 cells after transfection (S7 Fig). The other six strains with deletions in the RBD region, Rf4075, Rs4081, Rs4085, Rs4235, As6526 and Rp3 (S1 Fig) failed to be rescued, as no cytopathic effects was observed and viral replication cannot be detected by immunofluorescence assay in Vero E6 cells (S7 Fig). In contrast, when Vero E6 cells were respectively infected with the two successfully rescued chimeric SARSr-CoVs, WIV1-Rs4231S and WIV1-Rs7327S, and the newly isolated Rs4874, efficient virus replication was detected in all infections (Fig 7).
Similarity plot based on the full-length genome sequence of civet SARS CoV SZ3.
Full-length genome sequences of all SARSr-CoV detected in bats from the cave investigated in this study were used as reference sequences. The analysis was performed with the Kimura model, a window size of 1500 base pairs and a step size of 150 base pairs.
The authors then checked if their chimeras can infect human cells, and this time they used a live synthetic virus, rather than not pseudo-typed HIV constructs as before:
To assess whether the three novel SARSr-CoVs can use human ACE2 as a cellular entry receptor, we conducted virus infectivity studies using HeLa cells with or without the expression of human ACE2. All viruses replicated efficiently in the human ACE2-expressing cells. The results were further confirmed by quantification of viral RNA using real-time RT-PCR (Fig 8).
Baric-2019
Ralph Baric also showed no signs of slowing down. At the end of October 2019, his group submitted for publication another paper on the importance of spike protein protease cleavage (remember the furin site?) to crossing the ‚Äúbarrier to zoonotic infection‚Äù by coronaviruses:
Together, these results demonstrate that protease cleavage is also the primary barrier to infection of Vero cells with HKU5-CoV. Examining further, we compared the predicted cleavage at S1/S2 border, S2‚Äô, and the endosomal cysteine protease site across MERS, PDF2180, and HKU5 spikes (Fig. 6D) (26). For the S1/S2 site, MERS, Uganda, and HKU5 maintain the RXXR cleavage motif, although the different interior amino acids may alter efficiency. For the S2‚Äô sequence, MERS and HKU5 also retain the RXXR motif; however, the Uganda spike lacks the first arginine (SNAR), potentially impacting cleavage.
As I recall the spirit of scientific competition between the groups of Baric and Shi Zhengli, I can‚Äôt help but wonder whether someone was conducting similar research in the Wuhan lab in 2019.
Gain-of-Function: Risky Business
Many people who first learn about the above research ask a very valid question: ‚ÄúBut why?‚Äù Why do scientists create chimeric killer viruses? The politically correct answer is to develop preventive measures (drugs or vaccines) from possible natural chimeras and to understand the risks of their occurrence. Here, in fact, is what Baric, Shi Zhengli, and co-authors themselves wrote on this subject in their famous 2015 paper:
In addition to offering preparation against future emerging viruses, this approach must be considered in the context of the US government‚Äìmandated pause on gain-of-function (GOF) studies. On the basis of previous models of emergence (Fig. 4a,b), the creation of chimeric viruses such as SHC014-MA15 was not expected to increase pathogenicity. Although SHC014-MA15 is attenuated relative to its parental mouse-adapted SARS-CoV, similar studies examining the pathogenicity of CoVs with the wild-type Urbani spike within the MA15 backbone showed no weight loss in mice and reduced viral replication. Thus, relative to the Urbani spike‚ÄìMA15 CoV, SHC014-MA15 shows a gain in pathogenesis (Fig. 1). On the basis of these findings, scientific review panels may deem similar studies building chimeric viruses based on circulating strains too risky to pursue, as increased pathogenicity in mammalian models cannot be excluded. Coupled with restrictions on mouse-adapted strains and the development of monoclonal antibodies using escape mutants, research into CoV emergence and therapeutic efficacy may be severely limited moving forward. Together, these data and restrictions represent a crossroads of GOF research concerns; the potential to prepare for and mitigate future outbreaks must be weighed against the risk of creating more dangerous pathogens. In developing policies moving forward, it is important to consider the value of the data generated by these studies and whether these types of chimeric virus studies warrant further investigation versus the inherent risks involved.
Were these words prophetic? At the end of 2014, the United States introduced a moratorium on state financing of such gain-of-function studies, but it was shortly canceled (in 2017). In China, no moratorium on such studies was introduced, on the contrary, they went full steam ahead with creating new ‚Äúsuper labs‚Äù of the highest biosafety level (BSL-4), as in 2017 in Wuhan:
To be clear, the Wuhan lab was allowed to work with coronaviruses even before 2017, as these viruses only required a BSL-3 rating which the Wuhan Institute of Virology had. But their aspirations to obtain BSL-4 made a lot of people uneasy, including fellow researchers:
Future plans include studying the pathogen that causes SARS, which also doesn‚Äôt require a BSL-4 lab, before moving on to Ebola and the West African Lassa virus, which do. Some one million Chinese people work in Africa; the country needs to be ready for any eventuality, says Yuan. ‚ÄúViruses don‚Äôt know borders.‚Äù
‚Ä¶
The plan to expand into a network heightens such concerns. One BSL-4 lab in Harbin is already awaiting accreditation; the next two are expected to be in Beijing and Kunming, the latter focused on using monkey models to study disease. Lina says that China‚Äôs size justifies this scale, and that the opportunity to combine BSL-4 research with an abundance of research monkeys ‚Äî Chinese researchers face less red tape than those in the West when it comes to research on primates ‚Äî could be powerful. ‚ÄúIf you want to test vaccines or antivirals, you need a non-human primate model,‚Äù says Lina. But Ebright is not convinced of the need for more than one BSL-4 lab in mainland China. He suspects that the expansion there is a reaction to the networks in the United States and Europe, which he says are also unwarranted. He adds that governments will assume that such excess capacity is for the potential development of bioweapons. ‚ÄúThese facilities are inherently dual use,‚Äù he says. The prospect of ramping up opportunities to inject monkeys with pathogens also worries, rather than excites, him: ‚ÄúThey can run, they can scratch, they can bite.‚Äù Trevan says China‚Äôs investment in a BSL-4 lab may, above all, be a way to prove to the world that the nation is competitive. ‚ÄúIt is a big status symbol in biology,‚Äù he says, ‚Äúwhether it‚Äôs a need or not.‚Äù
Interestingly, in addition to Wuhan, the Chinese government planned to open a new BSL-4 lab in Kunming, with an eye to testing vaccines on primates. As you might recall, Kunming is not only the capital of Yunnan, but it is also where Shi Zhengli found the strains Rs3367 and RsSHC014 in nearby caves. By the way, primate testing was mentioned by Baric and Shi Zhengli as possible next steps for the development of preventive vaccines against potential future outbreaks of coronaviruses in their famous 2015 paper:
However, further testing in nonhuman primates is required to translate these finding into pathogenic potential in humans. Importantly, the failure of available therapeutics defines a critical need for further study and for the development of treatments. With this knowledge, surveillance programs, diagnostic reagents and effective treatments can be produced that are protective against the emergence of group 2b‚Äìspecific CoVs, such as SHC014, and these can be applied to other CoV branches that maintain similarly heterogeneous pools.
Maybe by 2019 the creation and testing of potential vaccines against various SARS-like coronaviruses was already in full swing.
Beware of Lab
Let‚Äôs now take a look at the lab leak hypothesis. But first, I will provide some historical context, including previous confirmed lab leaks, as many of those happened before. First and foremost, lab leaks of the first SARS-CoV: initially, in the summer of 2003 in Singapore, then in December 2003 in Taiwan, and in the spring of 2004 twice in Beijing.
There were close calls in Europe and the USA, although thankfully no infections occurred there. For example, a French lab once lost vials with SARS, and an American BSL-4 laboratory in Texas, lost a vial containing Guanarito (Venezuelan hemorrhagic fever virus):
Only one scientist worked with the virus, and Reyes said the lab suspects that scientist accidentally threw the vial away in November.
‚Ä¶
Galveston biolab requires the most stringent safety measures because it studies biosafetly level BSL-4 materials, or dangerous infectious diseases that have no vaccines or cures. BSL-4 materials include Guanarito, Ebola and smallpox.
History knows other, much larger-scale leaks. For example, the ‚Äúresurrection‚Äù of the H1N1 flu virus in 1977, which had previously been considered extinct. Yes, this is the virus of the famous ‚ÄúSpanish flu‚Äù:
Human influenza H1N1 viruses appeared with the 1918 pandemic, and persisted, slowing accumulating small changes in its genome (with a major change in 1947), until the H2N2 ‚ÄúAsian‚Äù flu appeared in 1957, causing a worldwide pandemic. H1N1 influenza virus then apparently became extinct, and was not isolated for 20 years. In 1969 the ‚ÄúHong Kong‚Äù H3N2 virus replaced the H2N2 virus, and is still circulating. In September 1977 an H1N1 influenza virus was isolated from human infections in the Far East region of the Soviet Union, and in early 1978 the Chinese reported they had isolated H1N1 virus in May of 1977 in northeast China adjacent to the Soviet outbreak. Using the early genetic tools available at the time, the 1977 H1N1 virus was found to be closely related to H1N1 human influenza viruses circulating in 1949‚Äì1950, but not to those circulating earlier or later.
‚Ä¶
Only since 2009‚Äì2010 did major papers begin to state directly the 1977 emergence of H1N1 influenza was a laboratory related release: ‚ÄúThe most famous case of a released laboratory strain is the re-emergent H1N1 influenza A virus which was first observed in China in May of 1977 and in Russia shortly thereafter.‚Äù
‚Ä¶
The speculation that the 1977 release may have been related to H1N1 vaccine research is supported by the observation that in the initial outbreaks in China, nine of the ten viral isolates expressed ‚Äútemperature sensitivity‚Äù (Kung 1978). Temperature sensitivity normally an uncommon trait, but one that was in the 1970s (and still is) a fundamental trait for making live attenuated influenza vaccines. Temperature sensitivity generally occurs only after a series of substantial laboratory manipulations and selections. Interestingly, further investigation indicated the circulating strains in 1977‚Äì78 were often comprised of mixed temperature-sensitive and normal components, and that temperature sensitivity apparently disappeared from the post-1978 H1N1 lineage rapidly. Escape of a mid-protocol population of H1N1 virus undergoing laboratory selection for temperature sensitive mutants would provide such a mixed population. In 1976‚Äì77 laboratory personnel in their late teens or early 20s would not have been exposed to pre-1957 H1N1 influenza viruses, and been susceptible to laboratory infections. The low severity of the 1977 pandemic might be in part due to the temperature sensitivity of the virus, a trait that limits virus replication in pulmonary tissues.
It seems that the creation of temperature-sensitive viral mutants to develop potentially attenuated vaccines was widespread at the end of the twentieth century. If you remember, in 1990, Ralph Baric himself also experimented with the creation of temperature-sensitive coronavirus strains.
Could something like this have caused the Covid-19 pandemic? Several options are possible ‚Äî from a leak during development of a potential vaccine to fundamental research on laboratory recombination of the bat and pangolin viruses. Some particularly ambitious researcher could even decide to combine the two ‚Äúfashionable research themes‚Äù ‚Äî adding a furin site and transplanting RBM from a strain of one species (pangolin) to another (bats), so that later, confirming the increased virulence of the new chimeric virus, they can wax poetic about the dangers of the same recombination happening in Yunnan caves or wet markets. And if such a researcher could even pre-emptively develop a vaccine against this and other potential chimeras, all sorts of accolades could await.
Am I then saying this is what happened? Of course not, I do not claim to know what happened. Today, there is no evidence of this. For now, there is just a series of strange coincidences ‚Äî for example, that the outbreak of the Yunnan coronavirus occurred thousands of kilometers from Yunnan in a wet market closest to the Wuhan Institute of Virology. Or maybe not at the wet market, as 3 of the first 4 patients had no ties to the market. Plus, there are coincidences in the structural features of the CoV2 genome, which resemble manipulations that virologists have repeatedly carried out in the lab. But coincidence is not proof.
Moreover, coincidences happen, and CoV2 could obviously have arisen naturally. It is not yet clear exactly how ‚Äî for this, the bat and pangolin strains must have met in the same cell of some animal in Wuhan, since the outbreak occurred there (otherwise we would have seen other outbreaks along the path that animal would have taken to get to Wuhan). Given that bats were not sold in the Wuhan market, and generally hibernate at this time of the year, and that no other carriers of ancestral strains have yet been identified, the exact scenario of natural emergence remains a mystery.
On the opposite side of the balance, giving credence to the lab hypothesis, there are reports that in 2018, American experts were quite alarmed after their visit to the Wuhan Institute of Virology and conversation with Shi Zhengli. Their ‚Äúlab tour‚Äù resulted in two diplomatic dispatches to Washington in which they noted a number of safety weaknesses:
Sources familiar with the cables said they were meant to sound an alarm about the grave safety concerns at the WIV lab, especially regarding its work with bat coronaviruses. The embassy officials were calling for more U.S. attention to this lab and more support for it, to help it fix its problems.
‚Ä¶
‚ÄúDuring interactions with scientists at the WIV laboratory, they noted the new lab has a serious shortage of appropriately trained technicians and investigators needed to safely operate this high-containment laboratory,‚Äù states the Jan. 19, 2018, cable, which was drafted by two officials from the embassy‚Äôs environment, science and health sections who met with the WIV scientists. (The State Department declined to comment on this and other details of the story.)
The Chinese researchers at WIV were receiving assistance from the Galveston National Laboratory at the University of Texas Medical Branch and other U.S. organizations, but the Chinese requested additional help. The cables argued that the United States should give the Wuhan lab further support, mainly because its research on bat coronaviruses was important but also dangerous.
It is somewhat ironic the Wuhan lab received guidance from the Texas laboratory in Galveston, which at one time had itself lost a vial with a Guanarito virus: Wuhan specialists were trained at Galveston, which was even reported in the Wuhan Institute‚Äôs own newsletter (though, that publication has been deleted from the WIV website, but it is still available at the Wayback Machine):
A couple of final touches to the family portrait of laboratory leaks: in November 2019, an outbreak of brucellosis (a bacterial infection) occurred in two research centers in Lanzhou, China, infecting over 100 researchers who worked there. American labs have also not been immune to outbreaks, although not on the same scale:
Possible Hallmarks of Lab Origin?
Let us now turn our attention back to the virus itself. Does it have any obvious signs of lab manipulation? First, a few words about what ‚Äúobvious‚Äù means. Any mutation can arise naturally, and even if the amino acid insert that had created the furin site in CoV2 was not ‚ÄúPRRA‚Äù but ‚ÄúMADEINWVHANPRRA‚Äù, there would still be a non-zero chance that it arose by accident. But for us, and for any court, I think this would be enough to prove lab origin beyond a reasonable doubt.
The main problem with such evidence is that even in a lab-made virus it simply may not exist. Basically, a good genetic engineer can create a synthetic virus that would be indistinguishable from a natural one. Moreover, often researchers deliberately introduce some synonymous mutations into their designs so that later they can discern their strain from natural ones. But if the creators choose not to reveal these markers, it is impossible to distinguish them from natural mutations.
But sometimes traces of manipulation may remain, especially if the creators do not try to hide them. First of all, I am talking about the spots in virus genome where its DNA is cut (recall that RNA virus manipulations are carried out in complementary DNA constructs). This occurs when virus creators need cut out a segment, or stitch together new segments. After all, DNA cannot be cut in arbitrary places (CRISPR aside), but only where its nucleotide sequence (usually 4‚Äì6 ‚Äúletters‚Äù) forms a sequence recognized by some restriction enzyme, that is, an enzyme that can cut a nucleotide chain. However, such an analysis is complicated by the fact that there are hundreds of different types of restriction enzymes used in genetic engineering. But let‚Äôs try it anyways.
As a baseline, here is an example of the work of the Baric group from 2008, where they took Bat-SCoV and replaced its RBD by an RBD from human SARS. Here‚Äôs how they describe the creation of their chimera:
Schematic representation of SARS-CoV and Bat-SCoV variants.
(A) Schematic representation of SARS-CoV and Bat-SCoV (GenBank accession no. FJ211859) genomes and reverse genetics system. (Top) Arrowheads indicate nsp processing sites within the ORF1ab polyprotein (open arrowheads, papain-like proteinase mediated; filled arrowheads, nsp5 [3C-like proteinase] mediated). Immediately below are the fragments used in the reverse genetics system, labeled A through F. The fragments synthesized to generate Bat-SCoV exactly recapitulate the fragment junctions of SARS-CoV with the exception that the Bat-SCoV has 2 fragments, Bat-E1 and Bat-E2, which correspond to the SARS-E fragment.
As you can see, the Baric group first created a synthetic clone of Bat-SCoV in the same pattern as they used for their synthetic clone of SARS-CoV. That is, for the bat clone, they used the same 6 segments with the same restriction enzyme sites that they had previously used for SARS-CoV, which allowed them to swap virus segments between different strains like Lego pieces. Here is their detailed description:
Viruses containing PCR-generated insertions within the viral coding sequence were produced by using the SARS-CoV assembly strategy (24, 33, 53) with the following modifications. Briefly, for Bat-F virus, full-length cDNA was constructed by ligating restriction products from SARS-CoV fragments A‚ÄìE and Bat-SCoV fragment F, which required a BglI-NotI digestion. For Bat-SCoV and Bat-SRBD, Bat-SRBM, and Bat-Hinge, plasmids containing the 7 cDNA fragments of the Bat-SCoV genome were digested by using BglI for Bat-A, Bat-B, Bat-C, and Bat-D, BglI and AflII for Bat-E1 and Bat-E2, and BglI and NotI for Bat-F. Digested, gel-purified fragments were simultaneously ligated together. Transcription was driven by using a T7 mMessage mMachine kit (Ambion), and RNA was electroporated into Vero cells (24, 53).
All these three-letter abbreviations (BglI, AflII, NotI, etc.) in the sentence highlighted above are different types of restriction enzymes. Let‚Äôs see if there are any differences in the restriction enzyme sites in the spike protein sequence of the chimera compared to the genome of the original SARS-CoV:
As can be seen, the restriction enzyme sites of the chimera are almost identical to those in the original sequences in Bat-SCoV or SARS from where they were taken. The only differences are noticeable at the ‚Äústitching‚Äù sites of the inserted SARS piece. Here, for example, is the left (5‚Äô-) edge of the insert:
Here Bat-SCoV and SARS turned out to have a common identical region of nucleotides (the intersection of cyan and pink regions), and there are no new restriction enzyme sites at the stitching site of the two sequences, on the contrary, the SspI site from SARS disappeared. And here is the right (3‚Äô-) edge of the insert:
Here, on the contrary, all the original restriction enzyme sites remain at the site of ligation, and even new ones appear, for example, EcoRII. Had I not known that the chimeric genome is the result of lab manipulations, could I deduce this by looking at these 3 sequences? Not really, and even if some suspicion did creep in, it would certainly not be beyond a reasonable doubt. Perhaps it would be obvious to specialists in genetic engineering by some other signs, and, if so, I hope they speak up.
But in any case, let‚Äôs compare the RaTG13spike protein to CoV2 and pangolin-2019. Just in case something does jump out.
This is what the RBD (highlighted in light green) and RBM (yellow) look like for all three:
So, anything interesting? Well, I noticed some new restriction enzyme sites in CoV2 marked by red rectangles ‚Äî they coincide with unique mutations in the amino acid sequence (also marked by red rectangles in the amino acid sequences on the far right). Just in case, I highlighted several other new sites: blue rectangles, and a green rectangle located in the region of the only amino acid that differs between RBMs of CoV2 and pangolin-2019.
Let‚Äôs now compare the stretch around the PRRA insert that created the furin site in CoV2 among those three strains:
Here, too, several new restriction sites have appeared (highlighted in blue) on both sides of the new insert. Could they have been used to create a furin site? Theoretically, yes. Alternatively, the insertion could have been made via existing sites or even using the ‚Äúseamless‚Äù ligation method ‚Äî i.e. by creation of segments with new restriction sites which disappear after the complementary ends are joined. You might remember that the Baric group have applied this technology in 2002 to create a synthetic clone of murine coronavirus:
The interconnecting restriction site junctions that are located at the ends of each cDNA are systematically removed during the assembly of the complete full-length cDNA product, allowing reassembly without the introduction of nucleotide changes.
In 2003 they have used this approach again for a synthetic clone of SARS-CoV:
To rapidly assemble consensus clones, we used class IIS restriction endonucleases that cut at asymmetric sites and leave asymmetric ends. These enzymes generate strand-specific unique overhangs that allow the seamless ligation of two cDNAs with the concomitant loss of the restriction site.
Today, genetic manipulation techniques are so advanced and have become so routine that the October 2019 Beijing paper which had inserted a new furin site into the chicken coronavirus, only devoted a couple of sentences to their methodology:
2.2. Generation of Recombinant Virus
Recombinant rYN-S2/RRKR virus containing an S protein with the furin-S2‚Ä≤ site was generated by vaccinia recombination, as described previously [20,28]. Briefly, plasmid with the furin-S2‚Ä≤ site was generated using the Seamless Assembly kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and transfected into CV-1 cells infected by vaccinia virus containing the genome of YN-ŒîS-GPT. Furin-S2‚Äô site was introduced into the YN cDNA by homologous recombination using the transient dominant selection system [25].
The pace of progress in genetic engineering is astounding. Here is a description of the above Seamless Assembly kit:
The GeneArt¬Æ Seamless Cloning and Assembly Kit enables the simultaneous and directional cloning of 1 to 4 PCR fragments, consisting of any sequence, into any linearized vector, in a single 30-minute room temperature reaction. The kit contains everything required for the assembly of DNA fragments, and their transformation into E. coli for selection and growth of recombinant vectors.
‚Ä¢ Speed and Ease ‚Äî Clone up to 4 DNA fragments, with sequence of your choice, simultaneously in a single vector (up to 13 Kb); no restriction digestion, ligation or recombination sites required
‚Ä¢ Precision and Efficiency ‚Äî Designed to let you clone what you want, where you want, in the orientation you want, and achieve up to 90% correct clones with no extra sequences left behind

Up to 4 DNA fragments can be joined in a desired orientation in about half an hour, without having to deal with restriction enzymes or ligation. Once you‚Äôre done, quickly ‚Äúupload‚Äù your creation into E. coli to propagate the resulting design. Easy-peasy!
In summary, the restriction enzyme site analysis did not yield anything conclusive. It did, however, point out that not only CoV2 is quite unique, but so is RaTG13, and we should continue digging into the origins of both.
Codon Preferences
For these purposes, I decided to take a look at codon usage bias to check which strains look like CoV2 and RaTG13 the most. It is known that viruses tend to adapt their codon signature to the preferences of their hosts, so I expected to see RaTG13 exhibit a similar pattern to other bat viruses, and also hoped to see a difference from pangolin strains.
SARS-CoV, for example, is very similar to Rs3367 and RsSCH014, as one might expect:
Among themselves, by the way, SARS, MERS and CoV2 do differ:
RaTG13 is similar to CoV2, which is also to be expected:
But RaTG13 is actually not that close to the pangolin strains, and the pangolin strains are not exactly identical to each other:
RaTG13 also differs from ZXC21 and ZC45:
Looking at Yunnan strains, RaTG13 is quite distant from Rs3367 and RsSCH014, and closer to LYRa11, but also with noticeable differences:
In general, as before, RaTG13 and CoV2 stand out in a class of their own. I was also intrigued by the AAA codon ‚Äî they use it much more often than their fellow strains:
This is probably just another coincidence, but a similar proportion between AAA and AAG is observed in E. coli. Can the cDNA codon signature change if it is being cultivated for a long time in cell culture? Maybe, but I haven‚Äôt yet dug into this topic very deeply.
[UPDATED] I also decided to check codon usage patterns between RaTG13 and other Ra strains collected from the same abandoned mineshaft in Mojiang where in 2013 Shi Zhengli‚Äôs group found strain RaBtCoV/4991 (KP876546) that shares an identical 370-bp RdRp segment with RaTG13. Unfortunately, only 816-bp segments of the RdRp gene were available for the other Ra strains (RaBtCoV/3750 and RaBtCoV/4307‚Äì2), so I extracted the corresponding 816-bp segment from RaTG13 for the purposes of codon usage comparison. RaTG13 again differed substantially, while the other two strains clustered together:
So codon analysis also did not reveal any obvious signs of lab origins, but once again confirmed the uniqueness of CoV2 and RaTG13. What does this leave us with? So far, just a number of oddities, which, as scientists like to say, taken together, do not allow us to reject the lab origin hypothesis of CoV2.
The Nature Paper vs. the Lab-Made Hypothesis
But didn‚Äôt that Nature article refute the lab-made hypothesis? No, not really. There is no irrefutable evidence against it in the paper, just a loud ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt believe so‚Äù based on a shaky foundation. Judge for yourself ‚Äî here are the authors‚Äô key arguments in support of their conclusions:
While the analyses above suggest that SARS-CoV-2 may bind human ACE2 with high affinity, computational analyses predict that the interaction is not ideal and that the RBD sequence is different from those shown in SARS-CoV to be optimal for receptor binding. Thus, the high-affinity binding of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein to human ACE2 is most likely the result of natural selection on a human or human-like ACE2 that permits another optimal binding solution to arise. This is strong evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is not the product of purposeful manipulation.
In the original paper, the quoted sentences are just below the diagram showing identical RBMs between CoV2 and pangolin-2019. So I am puzzled as to what ‚Äúcomputational analysis‚Äù has to do with anything. Obviously, the most likely scenario for the lab-made hypothesis is the transfer of RBM from one strain to another ‚Äî which virologists have done many times before. Therefore, the author‚Äôs chain of arguments does not make sense: ‚Äúcomputer says binding is not ideal, thus CoV2 must be the result of natural selection. Ergo, this is strong evidence that CoV2 is not lab-made.‚Äù Wait, just because CoV2 differs from some ‚Äúoptimal‚Äù virus, doesn‚Äôt mean it could not have been created in a lab. Not the lab trying to create ‚Äúoptimal‚Äù bioweapons, but a lab creating chimeras of naturally found strains, say, in bats and pangolins.
The authors continue to surprise:
Furthermore, if genetic manipulation had been performed, one of the several reverse-genetic systems available for betacoronaviruses would probably have been used. However, the genetic data irrefutably show that SARS-CoV-2 is not derived from any previously used virus backbone.
Again, the same questionable logic dressed in categorical adjectives: ‚Äúgenetic analysis irrefutably proves that CoV2 was not created on the basis of previously known strains!‚Äù Well thanks, Captain Obvious. But why couldn‚Äôt potential creators of CoV2 make a cDNA backbone from unpublished strains related to or even derived from RaTG13? Then they could easily insert the pangolin RBM into it, as well as add a furin site (or maybe the cDNA backbone already had one). Virologists have been doing things like this for 20 years, and modern genetic engineering tools make such manipulations accessible even to a grad student.
As for the chances of the furin site arising in cell culture, the authors also express strange ideas:
The acquisition of both the polybasic cleavage site and predicted O-linked glycans also argues against culture-based scenarios. New polybasic cleavage sites have been observed only after prolonged passage of low-pathogenicity avian influenza virus in vitro or in vivo. Furthermore, a hypothetical generation of SARS-CoV-2 by cell culture or animal passage would have required prior isolation of a progenitor virus with very high genetic similarity, which has not been described. Subsequent generation of a polybasic cleavage site would have then required repeated passage in cell culture or animals with ACE2 receptors similar to those of humans, but such work has also not previously been described.
First off, the authors themselves cite previous works where the furin site arose in vitro as viruses were cultured in cells. And second, what do they mean, a strain with high genetic similarity has not been described ‚Äî what about RaTG13? If it had its RBM replaced by one from the pangolin strain, and then the chimeric strain was cultured in vitro, then the furin site could well have arisen in this matter. Additionally, the new strain could thus acquire other mutations that distinguish CoV2 from RaTG13 and pangolin-2019.
But in terms of the potential lab-based origin of the furin site, I am more inclined to hypothesize a specific insertion ‚Äî as in the Beijing paper from October 2019 with chicken coronavirus. After that, the synthetic strain could have acquired new mutations by subsequent culturing in vitro or in vivo ‚Äî like the MA15 murine strain in 2007, for example. Or maybe even using the same mouse model with humanized lung tissues and immune system that was created at UNC by Baric‚Äôs and other groups in 2018, in which they reported testing several viruses including MERS:
The human innate and adaptive immune system of BLT-L mice
We generated an in vivo model with human lung implants and an autologous human immune system by constructing BLT mice with autologous human lung implants (BLT-L humanized mice).
Finally, even if CoV2 is the product of selection rather than intelligent design, that does not rule out a lab leak either ‚Äî selection can happen in the lab just as well, both natural and artificial kinds. Different strains can recombine in research animals or in vitro by design or by chance.
On the 4% Genome Difference between RaTG13 and Cov2
Some critics of the lab-made hypothesis claim that the observed ~4% genetic difference between RaTG13 and CoV2 is too high to have possibly occurred in a lab if RaTG13 itself was used as a backbone. Observed mutation rates for RNA viruses vary widely ‚Äî from 10‚Åª‚Å∂ to 10‚Åª‚Å¥ nucleotides per replication in vitro, and in humans CoV2 seems to mutate at a rate of 25 mutations per year. Thus, the logic goes, it would take years, if not decades, for two strains to diverge by 4%. While that is a valid point, there are several issues with that line of reasoning.
First, in vitro mutation speeds (i.e. per unit of time) are much higher, as you can passage cells much more often than infect new animals. As SARS and MERS in vitro experiments showed, significant mutations might be observed after only a few passages. For example, the 2004 paper reported that only after 600 passages there already was a 2.1% difference in the genomic sequences of spike proteins between the original strain and its progeny:
Moreover, in the presence of some antiviral compounds, such as nucleoside analogs (e.g. ribavirin or remdesivir), mutation rates in RNA viruses can increase even further:
We obtained an estimate of the spontaneous mutation rate of ca. 10‚Åª‚Å¥ substitutions per site or lower, a value within the typically accepted range for RNA viruses. A roughly threefold increase in mutation rate and a significant shift in mutation spectrum were observed in samples from patients undergoing 6 months of interferon plus ribavirin treatment. This result is consistent with the known in vitro mutagenic effect of ribavirin and suggests that the antiviral effect of ribavirin plus interferon treatment is at least partly exerted through lethal mutagenesis.
So if ancestral CoV2 was being lab-tested to assess how its mutagenesis might affect the efficacy of potential vaccines or antiviral drugs, it could have accumulated mutations at a much higher rate.
But possibly, the biggest problem with the 4% difference argument is that it relies on RaTG13 being exactly what WIV says it is. If we are to seriously consider the lab leak hypothesis, we must concede that it does not make sense to blindly trust the data released by the very lab suspected of the leak. If the leak did occur, as is the premise of the lab hypothesis, then the description of what RaTG13 is could be furthering the goal of covering up the leak.
Again, I am not claiming with certainty that is what is happening here. All I am saying is that this is what could have happened, and we need a lot more evidence before we can reach a definitive conclusion. One thing that could help rule out tampering with RaTG13 is having independent labs sequence the 2013 Yunnan samples that She Zhengli extracted RaTG13 from. WIV must still have them if they re-sequenced RaTG13 in 2020.
Shi Zhengli-2020
As I was writing this post, a fresh paper co-authored by Shi Zhengli came out, in which the authors tested a peptide which they have been studying for some time before against CoV2. That peptide was meant to be a pan-coronavirus inhibitor, and its designed mode of action was to block the fusion of a spike protein with a cell membrane. The authors, of course, mention the new furin site of CoV2, and suggest that it may play an important role in the much more efficient penetration of CoV2 into the cell:
In this study, we have shown that SARS-CoV-2 exhibits much higher capacity of membrane fusion than SARS-CoV, suggesting that the fusion machinery of SARS-CoV-2 is an important target for development of coronavirus fusion inhibitors.
‚Ä¶
Generally, Œ≤-B coronaviruses lack the S1/S2 furin-recognition site, and their S proteins are uncleaved in the native state. For example, SARS-CoV enters into the cell mainly via the endosomal membrane fusion pathway where its S protein is cleaved by endosomal cathepsin L and activated. Inducing the S1/S2 furin-recognition site could significantly increase the capacity of SARS-CoV S protein to mediate cellular membrane surface infection.
In this context, I wonder whether the authors have previously conducted experiments on how adding a furin site can alter the effectiveness of their peptide (or other drugs or vaccines) against a given coronavirus.
Not to be outdone, Ralph Baric also joined the race to find drugs against CoV2. As I understand, he and co-authors took data on the effectiveness of their nucleoside analogue (Œ≤-D-N4-hydroxycytidine, NHC) against SARS-CoV and MERS that they already had, added some in vitro data on CoV2, and sent off the paper to print. Nucleoside analogues (such as the famous remdesivir) are a fundamentally different approach than Shi Zhengli et al. Here, the authors try to prevent viral replication by giving ‚Äúdefective‚Äù letters of the genetic alphabet to virus‚Äô copying machine, while Shi Zhengli and coauthors try to prevent the virus from entering the cell altogether. Theoretically, these approaches could be combined.
This is the End, Beautiful Friend
If you made it here by reading rather than scrolling, mad props to you. Hey, even if you scrolled, that‚Äôs cool too, and I apologize for the verbosity. I just didn‚Äôt anticipate that the rabbit hole would turn out to be a whole underground cave system. I hope that you found this deep dive into the world of virology interesting and enjoyed the exploration of the lab-made CoV2 hypothesis. In my opinion, the data I have presented, taken together, do not allow us to reject this possibility.
Let me be clear: this does NOT prove that CoV2 was synthesized in the laboratory. Yes, as we have seen above, from a technical standpoint, it would not be difficult for a modern virologist to create such a strain. But there is no direct evidence that anyone did this, and strange coincidences cannot pass for circumstantial evidence. On balance, the current chances against this are still higher than for the natural origins of CoV2. Moreover, even if CoV2 was indeed an unfortunate lab leak, the scientists themselves are not to blame, as they were working within the established international laws and guidelines on such research. Now, those who might be trying to cover up that leak, that‚Äôs a different story.
The opposite point is worth repeating too: the inverse hypothesis about the exclusively natural origin of the virus does not yet have strong evidence either. Until intermediate ancestors between RaTG13, pangolin-2019 and CoV2 are found, in whom we could trace the mosaic recombination that we observe in CoV2, the question of its origins remains open. In closing, there is no one better to quote on this matter than Ralph Baric himself:
What is the reservoir species of SARS-CoV-2?
They have not identified the actual reservoir species. Reports show that pangolins are potentially the intermediate host, but pangolin viruses are 88‚Äì98% identical to SARS-CoV-2. In comparison, civet and racoon dog strains of SARS coronaviruses were 99.8% identical to SARS-CoV from 2003. In other words, we are talking about a handful of mutations between civet strains, racoon dog strains and human strains in 2003. Pangolins [strains of CoV2] have over 3000 nucleotide changes, no way they are the reservoir species. Absolutely no chance.
So there you have it. It remains possible that the mysterious virus host was a lab:

This repository contains code used to extract details of preprints related to COVID-19 and visualize their distribution over time. Work by Nicholas Fraser and Bianca Kramer.
A citable version of this repository is also available on figshare, here: https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.12033672.
Note that this dataset is not exhaustive, but aims to collate information from some of the main sources of preprint metadata.
The process for collecting preprint metadata is documented fully here. In brief, preprint metadata are harvested from three sources: Crossref (using the rcrossref package), DataCite (using the rdatacite package) and arXiv (using the aRxiv package).
With respect to Crossref, all records with the type field defined as posted-content are included, as well as records from SSRN (where the type field is instead defined as journal-article ). Preprint records are then matched to known preprint repositories based on institution , publisher and group-title fields, and filtered for partial matches to keywords relating to COVID-19 (""coronavirus"", ""covid-19"", ""sars-cov"", ""ncov-2019"", ""2019-ncov"", ""hcov-19"", ""sars-2"") in either their titles or abstracts. For DataCite, all records with the resourceType field defined as Preprint are included. Preprint records are matched to known preprint repositories based on client fields, and filtered for COVID-19 related terms in the same way as for Crossref. With respect to arXiv, records are harvested by searching directly for COVID-19 related keywords in titles or abstracts using the built-in search functionality of the aRxiv package.
In some cases, multiple preprint metadata records are registered for a single preprint (e.g. ChemRxiv registers a new Crossref record for each new version of a preprint). In these cases, only the earliest posted version is included in this dataset. Additionally, some preprints are deposited to multiple preprint repositories - in these cases all preprint records are included.",[],

All of Germany's states have announced plans to make face masks compulsory to combat the spread of coronavirus.
Bremen became the final federal region to back the measures, with its senate set to confirm the decision on Friday.
Mask use will be compulsory on public transport throughout Germany, and nearly all states will also make face coverings mandatory when shopping.
Chancellor Angela Merkel strongly recommended their use last week when she eased lockdown rules nationwide.
Different countries have issued different guidance on the use of face masks.
Austria made them compulsory when shopping at the start of this month, but on Wednesday Switzerland confirmed it would not make its citizens wear masks as it loosened its restrictions.

Germany's Robert Koch Institute (RKI) has confirmed 145,694 cases and recorded 4,879 deaths in total.
Wednesday's data showed a second consecutive day that new infections rose, with 281 deaths compared with 194 reported on Tuesday. Johns Hopkins University in the US puts the number of German deaths at 5,117.
Germany's federal vaccines institute approved clinical trials for a possible vaccine involving humans on Wednesday. About 200 healthy volunteers aged between 18 and 55 will be tested with variants of the drug, developed by US pharmaceutical giant Pfizer and German company BioNTech.
Scientists at the University of Oxford are set to start trials on humans on Thursday, the UK government says. Separate trials are also taking place in the US city of Seattle.
What are the rules in Germany?
The new rules come into force in most states from Monday, once they pass in local legislatures. But where face masks will be required differs from state.
All 16 states will make facial coverings a necessity on public transport. But in Berlin, it will not be compulsory to wear a mask when shopping.
This is also the case in the northern state of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania: that state has announced a fine of ‚Ç¨25 (¬£22; $27) for anyone caught without one on public transport. Other states have yet to specify punishments.

Rhineland-Palatinate in the south-west says pupils will be given reusable masks as they slowly start to return to school at the beginning of May, while in Bavaria masks are mandatory for everyone aged seven and over from Monday.
Even the type of mask is not consistently specified. Prime Minister Winfried Kretschmann of Baden-W√ºrttemberg has said medical masks should be reserved for health workers, while scarves or cloth covers would be sufficient for people on the street.
Many state leaders had previously questioned the need to impose the measures on residents.
Thuringia's premier, Bodo Ramelow, said that as neighbouring states Bavaria and Saxony had announced measures, his eastern state had decided to follow suit. Mr Ramelow, however, also said mask usage could create a false sense of security for wearers.
Are masks becoming compulsory elsewhere?
Since the outbreak began, the World Health Organization (WHO) has consistently said only the ill and those caring for the ill need to wear masks.
Research suggests they are not as effective as frequent hand washing with soap and water, and can give users false confidence.
But a number of states in Europe are starting to make masks compulsory on public transport and in shops, including Austria, Czech Republic and Slovakia.
Others have begun handing out masks to commuters, such as Spain. France has promised to produce enough masks for all its residents should they wish to wear one.",[],2020-04-22 16:04:19

‚ÄúTests have been carried out, two people have now been cured by this treatment,‚Äù Rajoelina told ministers, diplomats and journalists at the Malagasy Institute of Applied Research (IMRA), which developed the beverage.
‚ÄúThis herbal tea gives results in seven days,‚Äù he said.
Downing a dose, he said: ‚ÄúI will be the first to drink this today, in front of you, to show you that this product cures and does not kill.‚Äù
The drink, called COVID-Organics, is derived from artemisia a plant with proven efficacy in malaria treatment and other indigenous herbs, according to the IMRA.
But its safety and effectiveness have not been assessed internationally, nor has any data from trials been published in peer-reviewed studies. Mainstream scientists have warned of the potential risk from untested herbal brews.
The principal ingredient in the drink is derived from Artemisia annua or sweet wormwood. Dried leaves from the plant are considered to have medicinal properties in Madagascar. But there is no evidence to show it actually works against COVID-19, a respiratory disease that has claimed more than 165,000 lives and infected almost 2.5 million people across the world.
Herbal remedies made from A. annua leaves are often touted as a cure for malaria. But its use against malaria is controversial. The World Health Organization criticized A. annua‚Äôs use in 2012 report saying it couldn‚Äôt recommend the use of A. annua plant material, in any form, including tea, for the treatment or the prevention of malaria,‚Äù.
Rajoelina‚Äôs government brushed aside any such reservations and said the concoction would be offered to schoolchildren, as it was his duty was to ‚Äúprotect the Malagasy people‚Äù.
‚ÄúCovid-Organics will be used as prophylaxis, that is for prevention, but clinical observations have shown a trend towards its effectiveness in curative treatment,‚Äù said Dr. Charles Andrianjara, IMRA‚Äôs director-general.
The president also said the product will be made available for free to the poor.
The large Indian Ocean island has so far detected 121 cases and no fatality.
The pandemic has triggered a rush for herbal formulas, lemons and ginger in the belief that they can protect against the virus.
The US Centers for Disease Control (CDC), referring to claims for herbal or tea remedies, says: ‚ÄúThere is no scientific evidence that any of these alternative remedies can prevent or cure the illness caused by COVID-19. In fact, some of them may not be safe to consume.‚Äù","['Halligan Agade', 'Halligan Agade Is A New Media Editor At Cgtn-Africa Communications Expert Covering Environmental Issues', 'Gender Children', 'Women', 'Other Human Interest Stories.He Is A', 'Clean Oceans Campaigner.He Studied Bsc.Communications', 'Public Relations As Well As A Diploma In Television', 'Radio Production.']",2020-04-21 00:00:00

50,04B0855C-2794-4667-82F1-BB114629B575,aaron,https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2020/04/16/tracking-covid-19-excess-deaths-across-countries,Covid-19 data - Tracking covid-19 excess deaths across countries,"A S COVID-19 has spread around the world, people have become grimly familiar with the death tolls that their governments publish each day. Unfortunately, these tend to under-count the true number of fatalities that the disease has already caused. In many places, official daily figures exclude anybody who did not die in hospital or who did not test positive. Often the cause of death takes several days to establish and report, which creates a lag in the data. And even the most complete covid-19 records will not count people who were killed by conditions that might normally have been treated, had hospitals not been overwhelmed by a surge of patients needing intensive care.
[Jump to Italy, Spain, France, Britain, Netherlands, Sweden, Belgium, Austria, United States, Jakarta or Istanbul]
A better way to measure the damage caused by such a medical crisis is to look at ‚Äúexcess mortality‚Äù: the gap between the total number of people who died from any cause, and the historical average for the same place and time of year. The charts below use data from EuroMOMO, a network of epidemiologists who collect weekly reports on deaths from all causes in 24 European countries, covering 350m people.
Compared to the baseline average of deaths from 2009-19, the flu seasons of 2017, 2018 and 2019 were all unusually lethal. But the covid-19 pandemic, which arrived much later in the year, has already reached a higher peak‚Äîand would have been far more damaging without social-distancing measures. EuroMOMO‚Äôs figures suggest that there were about 140,000 excess deaths between March 16th and April 26th.
We cannot compare EuroMOMO‚Äôs reports directly to official covid-19 tolls, because the organisation does not publish absolute numbers of deaths for each country. Instead, we have gathered data separately from statistical bureaus around the world (see table below). Some Western nations began releasing regular updates in early April, as we first reported at the time. A few‚Äîsuch as Italy and the Netherlands‚Äîshow an excess of deaths that is double the official covid-19 tally for the same period.
That discrepancy will surely be greater in poorer countries, which have less capacity for testing and treating patients. For example, data about burials in Jakarta, Indonesia‚Äôs capital, suggest that the official covid-19 figures in March and April might have captured only 14% of the true toll. As more places start to publish their total mortality figures, The Economist will report and analyse them on this page.
Italy was the first European country to be overrun by the virus. On May 11th its official count of covid-19 deaths was over 30,000. Yet the true toll is much higher. Giorgio Gori, the mayor of Bergamo, a northern town hit especially hard, has said that the daily data are ‚Äúthe tip of the iceberg‚Ä¶too many victims are not included in the reports because they die at home.‚Äù The official covid-19 tally, published by the ministry of health, includes only people who tested positive before passing away.
So far, Italy‚Äôs national statistical bureau has only published figures of deaths from all causes up until March 31st, covering 6,800 of the country‚Äôs 7,900 municipalities. Between February 26th (the week Italy passed 50 official fatalities) and March 31st, the country suffered 12,400 official covid-19 deaths. This figure is 48% as high as the 25,800 excess deaths from all causes registered during the same period.
Spain has experienced a similar outbreak, with its official covid-19 death toll nearing 27,000 on May 11th, according to data from hospitals. The national epidemiology centre is publishing figures for deaths from all causes. Between March 11th (the week Spain passed 50 official fatalities) and April 28th, the country recorded 23,800 official covid-19 deaths. This figure is 78% as high as the 30,700 excess deaths from all causes registered in the same period.
France‚Äôs official covid-19 death toll accelerated rapidly in April, after its central health authority began including people who died in nursing and care homes. By May 11th, nearly 40% of the 26,000 recorded national fatalities came from such institutions. Our chart for the whole of France includes these extra numbers. But our charts for individual regions do not, because the care-home data have not yet been broken down geographically.
France‚Äôs national statistical bureau has published figures for deaths from all causes up to April 27th. Between March 10th (the week France passed 50 official fatalities) and April 27th, the country recorded 23,300 official covid-19 deaths, including those from care homes. This figure is 93% as high as the 25,000 excess deaths from all causes registered in the same period.
Britain‚Äôs daily covid-19 toll, which is published by the health ministry and based on submissions from hospitals and care homes, reached 33,000 on May 11th. However, the national statistical bureau has also produced an expanded covid-19 estimate, up until May 1st, after retrospectively analysing the probable causes mentioned on death certificates. These revised numbers are shown in our charts.
Between March 14th (the week Britain passed 50 official fatalities) and May 1st, the country recorded 36,600 official covid-19 deaths, according to the revised estimate. This figure is 72% as high as the 51,000 excess deaths from all causes registered in the same period.
The official covid-19 death toll in the Netherlands stood at 5,500 on May 11th. However, the national institute for public health, which publishes the daily figures, includes only people who have tested positive for the virus (often with a delay).
The Dutch national statistical bureau has published figures for deaths from all causes up to April 26th. Between March 16th (the week the Netherlands passed 50 official fatalities) and April 26th, the country recorded 4,500 official covid-19 deaths. This figure is 51% as high as the 8,700 excess deaths from all causes registered in the same period.
Sweden‚Äôs approach to fighting the virus has received much attention, as it is one of the few Western countries that has not enforced a widespread lockdown. On May 11th its official covid-19 death toll was 3,200, counting only people who had tested positive before passing away.
The Swedish national statistical bureau is publishing regular figures for deaths from all causes. Between March 18th (the week Sweden passed 50 official fatalities) and April 28th the country recorded 2,700 official covid-19 deaths. This figure is 92% as high as the 2,900 excess deaths from all causes registered in the same period.
After adjusting for population, Belgium has one of the highest official covid-19 death tolls in the world. On May 11th it stood at 8,700. The country‚Äôs health experts have pointed out that this high number includes victims who had coronavirus-like symptoms but did not test positive (many of whom died outside of hospitals). The official covid-19 figures have been retrospectively adjusted to list deaths on the day they happened, rather than the day they were eventually reported.
The Belgian national health institute has also released figures for deaths from all causes, up to April 26th. Between March 16th (the week Belgium passed 50 official fatalities) and April 26th the country recorded 7,600 official covid-19 deaths. This figure is 102% as high as the 7,400 excess deaths from all causes registered in the same period.
Austria locked down early and has suffered relatively few deaths from the virus. On May 11th its official covid-19 death toll was just over 600, counting only people who had tested positive before passing away.
The Austrian national statistical bureau has released figures for deaths from all causes, up to April 5th. Between March 23rd (the week Austria passed 50 official fatalities) and April 5th the country recorded 188 official covid-19 deaths. This figure is 57% as high as the 330 excess deaths from all causes registered in the same period.
After trailing behind the death tolls of many European countries at first, America‚Äôs official covid-19 death count has risen sharply. By May 11th it had recorded nearly 75,000 victims, more than any other country. Most American states do not publish recent records of deaths from all causes. But New York City, the worst-affected area, has provided reliable weekly data up to April 18th, as have the states of New Jersey, Illinois, Massachusetts and Michigan.
New York‚Äôs health department has adopted a similar approach to Britain‚Äôs statisticians, by expanding its definition of covid-19 fatalities and analysing death certificates retrospectively. As of May 11th, it has found an additional 5,100 people who had ‚Äúprobably‚Äù died of the virus, along with the 14,900 victims who had tested positive at that point. We have included these revised figures in our chart.
Between March 15th (the week New York passed 50 official fatalities) and April 18th, the city recorded 14,400 official covid-19 deaths, according to the revised estimate. This figure is 90% as high as the 16,000 excess deaths from all causes registered in the same period.
The handful of states with reliable data on excess deaths by April 18th had all suffered less than half as many as New York City. Their approaches to counting official covid-19 fatalities differ. Michigan includes people who ‚Äúprobably‚Äù died of the disease, which might explain why the state‚Äôs official death toll of 2,300 was 94% as high as its excess death toll of 2,400. By contrast, New Jersey only includes people who have tested positive. As a result, the state‚Äôs official death toll of 4,100 was 61% as high as its excess death toll of 6,600.
Indonesia is one of the first developing countries to have released data about excess mortality‚Äînot an official count of deaths from all causes, but instead a tally of burials from Jakarta's department of parks and cemeteries. Typically, the department records about 3,000 burials a month (accounting for roughly three-quarters of all people who die in the city). But during March and April, the department reported 8,800 burials in total, suggesting an excess of at least 2,800 fatalities.
Though Jakarta has been the epicentre of the covid-19 outbreak in Indonesia, at the end of April its official death toll was just 381, barely 14% as high as the excess burials. Even on May 11th, the city‚Äôs official tally of dead was still only 450. This suggests that the country is drastically under-counting the severity of the outbreak.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Turkey‚Äôs president, insists that his government has taken every precaution to fight covid-19, despite not imposing a full lockdown. On May 11th the country‚Äôs official death toll stood at 3,800. The last time the government produced a regional breakdown of the figures, on April 1st, Istanbul had roughly 40% of the nation‚Äôs deaths and 55% of confirmed cases.
However, data about burials from the city‚Äôs government suggest that between March 22nd and April 25th Istanbul suffered at least 3,100 excess deaths, when compared to the same period in previous years. If we assume that the city had roughly half of Turkey‚Äôs official toll in that period, that would come to 1,300 official covid-19 deaths, a figure that is 45% as high as the excess.

COVID-19: What‚Äôs New for May 12, 2020
Main updates on IHME COVID-19 predictions since May 10, 2020
First set of COVID-19 projections for 17 more countries
Over the last few months, the novel coronavirus has rapidly spread worldwide, leaving countries facing highly variable trajectories of COVID-19 infections and deaths. In turn, we have sought to produce COVID-19 predictions for increasingly more locations in addition to the US. We first added European Economic Area (EEA) countries on April 7, and then Puerto Rico and Canada (nationally and by province) on April 22.
Today we publish initial COVID-19 projections for 17 additional countries. These include the first set of COVID-19 estimates for nine countries in Latin America (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Mexico, Panama, and Peru), as well as eight additional countries with more than 50 COVID-19 deaths to date (Egypt, Israel, Malaysia, Moldova, the Philippines, South Korea, Turkey, and Ukraine). For Brazil and Mexico, initial estimates for a subset of states are also produced.
All currently included locations now have been incorporated into the multi-stage hybrid modeling framework. This means that the transmission dynamics component of our model, which also accounts for changes in key drivers (e.g., testing, mobility, easing of social distancing policies) and their relationships with viral transmission, has been applied to all locations and thus all corresponding estimates reflect this methodological advance.
We summarize key results below, with a special focus on newly added locations; these estimates can be explored further online: https://covid19.healthdata.org/projections.
At IHME, our guiding principle is to produce the best possible predictions given what we know today ‚Äì and to continually improve these estimates to support further gains against COVID-19 tomorrow. We will be continuing to update our projections in the coming days and weeks to incorporate the world‚Äôs evolving evidence base on COVID-19.
Key findings from today‚Äôs release (May 12, 2020)
A focus on Latin America
COVID-19 death predictions
For the nine Latin American countries included today, Brazil is likely to experience the highest projected toll by August, with predictions of cumulative COVID-19 deaths reaching 88,305 (estimate range of 30,302 to 193,786). Mexico, Peru, and Ecuador could have the next highest cumulative deaths from COVID-19 by August, as summarized in the table below.
Country Predictions for cumulative COVID-19 deaths through August from our May 12 release (today) Argentina 680 (414 to 1,420) Brazil 88,305 (30,302 to 193,786) Chile 687 (421 to 1,417) Colombia 2,157 (793 to 5,890) Dominican Republic 881 (595 to 1,435) Ecuador 5,215 (4,844 to 6,052) Mexico 6,859 (3,578 to 16,795) Panama 661 (362 to 1,345) Peru 6,428 (2,731 to 21,724) Results as of 05/12/2020

Hospital resource demand projections
With today‚Äôs release, we also publish a first set of estimates for hospital resource demand ‚Äì total hospital beds, ICU beds, and invasive ventilators ‚Äì for these locations. Based on the latest available data, demand for ICU beds could exceed current capacities in many countries. While potential shortages may also occur in the future, our estimates suggest that substantial shortages could already be happening in several locations. For instance, at the national level, Peru may be experiencing some of the most acute shortages, with predicted need of 1,040 ICU beds (estimate range of 793 to 1,677), with an estimated 88 available. Brazil‚Äôs estimates of ICU demand could surpass current capacities, with an estimated need of 6,836 (4,966 to 10,936), and 4,060 ICU beds available. Prediction indicate that demand for ICU beds could exceed Mexico‚Äôs current capacities; these patterns could change if COVID-19 epidemic trajectories shift.
Subnational locations in Brazil
In Brazil, S√£o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro are projected to have the highest cumulative COVID-19 deaths by August, potentially rising to 36,811 (11,097 to 81,774) and 21,073 (5,966 to 51,901) deaths, respectively. COVID-19 is currently projected to cause at least 5,000 cumulative deaths in Pernambuco, Cear√°, and Amazonas by August.
Location Predictions for cumulative COVID-19 deaths through August from our May 12 release (today) Brazil (nationally) 88,305 (30,302 to 193,786) Amazonas 5,039 (1,859 to 9,383) Bahia 2,443 (529 to 8,429) Cear√° 8,679 (2,894 to 18,593) Maranh√£o 4,613 (868 to 12,661) Paran√° 245 (170 to 397) Pernambuco 9,401 (2,468 to 23,027) Rio de Janeiro 21,073 (5,966 to 51,901) S√£o Paulo 36,811 (11,097 to 81,774) Results as of 05/12/2020

Based on the latest available data, most states may experience their epidemic peaks anytime between now (May 12-14) and June or beyond. As more data become available and more information on Brazil‚Äôs response is incorporated, these projections are likely to change.
High hospital resource demand to support COVID-19 patients could exceed several Brazilian states‚Äô current capacities ‚Äì and could worsen as many locations are seeing rising COVID-19 trajectories. Currently, Amazonas has an estimated need of 4,744 total hospital beds (estimate range of 2,933 to 9,776) while an estimated 1,026 beds are available. In terms of ICU beds, our estimates indicate Amazonas has a current need of 1,031 (704 to 1,945), with a capacity of 40 ICU beds.
Estimated infections appear to far exceed testing throughout Brazil, indicating a critical need for scaling up COVID-19 testing. This is particularly important given the country‚Äôs mounting death toll and widening gaps in hospital resources.
Subnational locations in Mexico
Based on the latest available data, Mexico could have 6,859 cumulative COVID-19 deaths (3,578 to 16,795) by August. Among currently included states, projections indicate that Mexico City, followed by Baja California, may have the highest cumulative COVID-19 deaths within the country (see table below).
Location Predictions for cumulative COVID-19 deaths through August from our May 12 release (today) Mexico (nationally) 6,859 (3,578 to 16,795) Baja California 1,171 (675 to 2,566) Mexico City 3,414 (1,396 to 9,671) Puebla 312 (190 to 831) Quintana Roo 465 (269 to 1,056) Sinaloa 292 (257 to 362) State of M√©xico 544 (445 to 800) Tabasco 660 (323 to 1,730) Results as of 05/12/2020

Many Mexican states may be currently experiencing acute hospital resource shortages, trends that are less striking at the national level. Based on the latest available data, Baja California and Quintana Roo could be seeing overall hospital bed demand exceeding current capacities, while all states are either at or far surpassing available ICU beds relative to need for supporting COVID-19 patients at present. Mexico City and Baja California appear to be experiencing the largest gaps in potential need and capacity in terms of ICU beds.
While our estimates indicate gradual progress in some states for scaling up testing (state of Mexico), Mexico‚Äôs testing for COVID-19 falls far below estimated infections. In the absence of concerted action to increase testing, particularly among states with larger epidemics, COVID-19 trajectories could worsen for Mexico.
A focus on other newly added locations
Among the newly added locations with more than 50 COVID-19 deaths to date in other regions, Turkey could have the highest cumulative COVID-19 death toll through August, at 5,263 deaths (estimate range of 4,563 to 6,508). As summarized in the table below, the Philippines and Ukraine may also see projected cumulative deaths exceeding 1,000 by August.
Country Predictions for cumulative COVID-19 deaths through August from our May 12 release (today) Egypt 2,047 (805 to 6,059) Israel 272 (266 to 279) Malaysia 112 (110 to 117) Moldova 399 (240 to 829) Philippines 1,735 (1,094 to 3,972) South Korea 346 (262 to 755) Turkey 5,263 (4,563 to 6,508) Ukraine 1,269 (603 to 3,396) Results as of 05/12/2020

For these nine newly included locations, predicted epidemic peaks and daily deaths at peak are highly variable; these patterns reflect the divergent epidemic trajectories that many of these locations have experienced to date. Current predictions indicate that South Korea and Malaysia likely saw predicted peaks in late March to early April, whereas others (e.g., Ukraine, Moldova, and Egypt) may be experiencing predicted peaks now or in the future.
At the national level, predictions of hospital resource demand generally did not exceed estimated capacities. Further, most of these countries showed positive trends in scaling up testing relative to estimated infections. South Korea‚Äôs success in COVID-19 testing is particularly evident, but other locations, such as Israel and Malaysia, have also been able to achieve and maintain high levels of testing. At the same time, some countries (e.g., the Philippines) have only recently been closing gaps in estimated infections and testing levels ‚Äì and confirmed cases remain low. Of note, Israel‚Äôs mobility trends have markedly increased by nearly 30 percentage points since its nadir around mid-April. This pattern corresponds with easing of previously implemented social distancing policies, though akin to many other countries, initial rises in mobility began prior to when formal easing actions occurred.
A focus on Europe
Based on the latest data and updated methods, a projected 43,479 cumulative COVID-19 deaths (estimate range of 40,110 to 50,128) could occur in the United Kingdom (UK) by August. Both Italy‚Äôs and France‚Äôs cumulative COVID-19 death tolls are now estimated to exceed 30,000. These updated predictions reflect the incorporation of these locations into our new multi-stage hybrid model, which was launched on May 4 but had been only fully applied to the US; we subsequently compare estimates for the five EEA countries with the highest projected cumulative deaths for today‚Äôs release relative to their May 4 predictions.
Compared with the May 4 estimates, these five locations ‚Äì the UK, Italy, France, Spain, and Belgium ‚Äì all have higher projected cumulative deaths; however, uncertainty intervals substantially overlap. Our death model updates for May 4 were applied to all included locations at that time, so these changes represent the combination of updated data inputs and the effects of accounting for transmission dynamics and the effects of potential drivers of viral transmission.

While most other EEA countries saw small to moderate increases in projected cumulative COVID-19 deaths since the May 4 release, Sweden was the main exception: today‚Äôs projections point to 5,760 cumulative COVID-19 deaths (estimate range of 4,426 to 9,089) by August, while the May 4 release had Sweden‚Äôs predictions at 10,196 (estimate range of 3,474 to 37,830). Although the uncertainty intervals overlap for both sets of predictions, the updated estimates are, on average, 4,436 deaths lower.
At the national level, most EEA countries appeared to have rapidly scaled up testing during or prior to rising estimated infections. Yet some countries have only recently closed gaps between estimated infections and testing (e.g., the Netherlands, Sweden, the UK), indicating a potential need to accelerate testing progress, especially as more countries move to ease previously implemented social distancing policies. Akin to patterns seen in the US, a number of locations saw rising mobility before distancing policies were being considered for easement; we will explore these results more in future releases.
A focus on the US
By August, the US‚Äôs cumulative COVID-19 death toll could be 147,040 (113,182 to 226,971). These estimates are higher than those published on May 10 (see table below), though their uncertainty intervals overlap considerably. National-level estimates and the US states with highest projected cumulative COVID-19 deaths are summarized below.

In addition to some of the states listed above, several saw sizeable changes since our May 10 release (see table below); however, most of these estimates have overlapping uncertainty intervals across releases. Exact reasons vary by state, but these changes are likely due to a combination of updated data inputs on COVID-19 epidemiologic indicators and key drivers of viral transmission like changes in testing and mobility, as well as easing of distancing policies. It is worth noting that the full potential effects of recent actions to ease social distancing policies, especially if robust containment measures have yet to be fully scaled up, may not be fully known for a few weeks due to the time periods between viral exposure, possible infection, and full disease progression.

Data and methods updates since our last release on May 10, 2020
Data updates
For all previously included locations, we have added reported data points on COVID-19 deaths, cases, mobility, and testing rates, as well as available information on social distancing policies for two days (May 9 and May 10 at about 10:00 p.m. Pacific). For all new locations, we include these data inputs from the first date of reporting through May 10.
Methods updates
As mentioned above, we have now incorporated previously included locations into our updated multi-stage hybrid modeling platform. We apply these same methods to all but one of the newly added locations: the exception is Ecuador. For Ecuador, we approximate the number of deaths differently than for other locations in our analysis. The reason we are using a different approach in Ecuador is that the number of reported deaths due to COVID-19 appears to be improbably low. We consider all-cause mortality, which gets reported on a weekly basis for Ecuador. Based on trends in all-cause mortality over the past few years, we estimate the number of additional deaths that occurred in Ecuador since March 2020. This corresponds to total excess mortality during the global pandemic. Not all of the excess mortality is due to COVID-19, though. To estimate what proportion of excess deaths we should attribute to COVID-19, we conducted an analysis in 14 other countries (13 European countries and the US) where we had data on both weekly reports of all-cause mortality and reliable data on COVID-19 deaths. In these locations, we took the ratio of all excess mortality to COVID-19 deaths. On average, we found that 55.3% of excess deaths during the pandemic were due to COVID-19 in countries with good registration systems. We subsequently applied this proportion to the number of excess all-cause deaths by week in Ecuador to get an estimate of the weekly deaths due to COVID-19. We plan to update this analysis on a regular basis.
What‚Äôs in the development pipeline for IHME COVID-19 predictions
Before we introduce new model components or improvements to our current analytical platform for predictions, IHME‚Äôs COVID-19 development team members test these additions or changes.
Based on currently available data and model testing progress, our immediate- and medium-term priorities are as follows:
Initial COVID-19 projections for additional countries . Data collation and processing for a wider set of locations and countries worldwide are in progress. We are currently working on adapting our prediction model to countries which have experienced more than 50 total COVID-19 deaths to date. With the increasing recognition of under-counting of COVID-19 deaths in many locations outside of EEA and North America, we are now exploring methods that can approximate excess mortality and incorporate such estimates into our COVID-19 models.

: State name. StatePolicy : String variable of state policies, as described below:
- EmergDec : Emergency declaration; currently includes State of Emergency, Public Health Emergency, and Public Health Disaster declarations.
- GathRecomAny : Any recommendation of against gathering that stops short of a formal mandate or restriction of gatherings. Includes uses phrasing such as ""advises against mass gatherings"" and ""constituents should avoid gatherings of more than 100"" that imply a recommendation versus restriction.
- GathRestrictAny : Restriction of any gathering; includes formal mandate or an executive order that uses phrasing such as ""prohibits all mass gatherings"" (per definition of mass gathering) and ""constituents must avoid gatherings of more than 100"". The first issuance of a gathering restriction of any size is coded with this date.
- GathRestrict1000 : Restriction of any gathering exceeding 1000 persons; coding followed the ""GathRestrict"" criteria. Some mandates include exceptions for essential businesses and organizations; these cases are still coded as a restriction applicable to the general public.
- GathRestrict500 : Restriction of any gathering exceeding 500 persons; coding followed the ""GathRestrict"" criteria and used the same coding approach as ""GathRestrict1000"" (i.e., considered a restriction if applicable to the general public).
- GathRestrict250 : Restriction of any gathering exceeding 250 persons; coding followed the same criteria as above.
- GathRestrict100 : Restriction of any gathering exceeding 100 persons; coding followed the same criteria as above.

- SchoolClose : Formal closing of (at minimum) public schools. Where possible, additional information on types of school closings are provided in ""PolicyCodingNotes"".
- RestaurantRestrict : Restriction or limitation of restaurants and other venues where food is consumed on-premises. Coding a case as a restriction requires a formal restriction on operations (e.g., offsite consumption only, limiting services to only take-away, delivery, or curbside drop-off) or mandate for substantially reducing operations (e.g., restaurant closure must occur unless 10 or fewer patrons are dining at at time).
- OtherBusinessClose : Mandate to fully close operations of any category of business. Coding a case as an other business closure requires the executive order to use phrasing indicative of a mandate (e.g., ""casinos must close"", ""operations at fitness centers and entertainment venues must cease by date""). A given state may have multiple cases of other business closures as they often occurred in phases (e.g., fitness centers and gyms on March 13, 2020; casinos and entertainment venues on March 15, 2020; personal service businesses like barbers and nail salons on March 19, 2020); thus, where possible, separate entries are provided for each mandate.
- NEBusinessClose : Mandate to close all non-essential businesses. Coding a case as a closure order requires the executive order to use phrasing indicative of a mandate (e.g., ""non-essential businesses are required to close"", ""non-essential businesses must cease operations by date""). Coding does not distinguish among states' classification of essential versus non-essential businesses, as they vary substantially by state.
- StayAtHome : Mandate for individuals to stay at home for all non-essential activities. Coding a case as a stay-at-home order mandate requires the executive order to using phrasing indicative of a mandate (e.g., ""must stay at home""); otherwise it is coded as 0 for the ""Mandate"" variable if it uses advisory phrasing. Coding does not distinguish among states' classification of essential versus non-essential activities, as they vary substantially by state. Shelter-in-place and stay-at-home orders are considered to be equivalent.
- StateCurfew : Mandates specific curfews at which residents are not to be outside their homes unless performing essential activities, as defined by the state. Coding a case as a state curfew requires specific curfew times (thus ""stay-at-home"" mandates were not considered curfews).
- Quarantine : Quarantines mandated for people entering the state, requiring a period of self-isolation. Quarantines may be imposed on all people entering the state, out-of-state residents, or travelers from a particular state or city. Quarantine length and who is covered by the policy can be found in the ""PolicyNotes"" variable. This policy type was added April 3, 2020.
- TravelRestrictIntra : Restrictions on travel within the state. These restrictions can be between cities or counties or within them.

- CaseIsolation : Policy that requires individuals with confirmed COVID-19 infection (via testing) or suspected COVID-19 infection to self-isolate for a specified period of time, or when they no longer test positive for infection. This policy type may also include requirements for quarantine of individuals who have been identified as high-risk for developing COVID-19 due to their close contact to patients with confirmed or suspected infections, including sharing the same residence. This policy type is different from ""Quarantine"" in this dataset, which refers to policies that require self-quarantine for individuals entering a state from any or particular points of origin. This policy type was added April 25, 2020.
- PublicMask : Policy that requires individuals to wear masks or other mouth and nose coverings when they are outside their places of residence in the public.

This reflects notable changes since the last update, especially if a date has been recoded (e.g., switching to coding orders enacted at 11:59 pm on date1 to date1+1 for its enactment timing) or the ""StatePolicy"" type has been amended (e.g., some initial coding of ""NEBusinessClose"" policies were applicable to non-essential in-person retail businesses only, not all non-essential businessess as defined by state).
State-level policy response: BETA DATASET (introduced May 2, 2020)
This dataset involves the transition of each state over to each policy action linked by policy ids, which enables better tracking of how policies have been enacted, expanded, eased, or ended over time. Our current dataset (""USstatesCov19distancingpolicy.csv"") will be maintained in parallel while we move each state over to this new format. Once that is complete, the BETA dataset will use the same file name as before. We will provide regular status updates.
File : ""USstatesCov19distancingpolicyBETA.csv"". Prior datasets are archived with date stamps in the format of YYYYMMDD.
: ""USstatesCov19distancingpolicyBETA.csv"". Prior datasets are archived with date stamps in the format of YYYYMMDD. PID : Policy id, or the unique id for each policy action. PIDs are used to link policy actions - Extends, Expands, Eases, Ends, Depends - to each other. They are six characters, with the first two characters being the two-letter state postal code and the next four being numerical format with leading zeros (i.e., PIDs of AK0001, AK0002 for two separate policies in Alaska). The numbers associated with each PID do not reflect the ordering of policy implementation, nor do they reflect the total number of mandates enacted by a given state. Multiple policy actions can come from a single executive order, and some earlier policies received ""later"" PIDs because they were identified upon further review. Instead, they should be viewed as unique identifiers for the different types of policy actions taken, which then can be linked together over time as they are extended, expanded, eased, or ended.

StatePolicy : String variable of state policies, as described below:
- EmergDec : Emergency declaration; currently includes State of Emergency, Public Health Emergency, and Public Health Disaster declarations.
- GathRecomAny : Any recommendation of against gathering that stops short of a formal mandate or restriction of gatherings. Includes uses phrasing such as ""advises against mass gatherings"" and ""constituents should avoid gatherings of more than 100"" that imply a recommendation versus restriction.
- GathRestrictAny : Restriction of any gathering; includes formal mandate or an executive order that uses phrasing such as ""prohibits all mass gatherings"" (per definition of mass gathering) and ""constituents must avoid gatherings of more than 100"". The first issuance of a gathering restriction of any size is coded with this date.
- GathRestrict1000 : Restriction of any gathering exceeding 1000 persons; coding followed the ""GathRestrict"" criteria. Some mandates include exceptions for essential businesses and organizations; these cases are still coded as a restriction applicable to the general public.
- GathRestrict500 : Restriction of any gathering exceeding 500 persons; coding followed the ""GathRestrict"" criteria and used the same coding approach as ""GathRestrict1000"" (i.e., considered a restriction if applicable to the general public).
- GathRestrict250 : Restriction of any gathering exceeding 250 persons; coding followed the same criteria as above.
- GathRestrict100 : Restriction of any gathering exceeding 100 persons; coding followed the same criteria as above.
- GathRestrict50 : Restriction of any gathering exceeding 50 persons; coding followed the same criteria as above.
- GathRestrict25 : Restriction of any gathering exceeding 25 persons; coding followed the same criteria as above.
- GathRestrict10 : Restriction of any gathering exceeding 10 persons; coding followed the same criteria as above.
- GathRestrict5 : Restriction of any gathering exceeding 5 persons; coding followed the same criteria as above.
- SchoolClose : Formal closing of (at minimum) public schools. Where possible, additional information on types of school closings are provided in ""PolicyCodingNotes"".
- RestaurantRestrict : Restriction or limitation of restaurants and other venues where food is consumed on-premises. Coding a case as a restriction requires a formal restriction on operations (e.g., offsite consumption only, limiting services to only take-away, delivery, or curbside drop-off) or mandate for substantially reducing operations (e.g., restaurant closure must occur unless 10 or fewer patrons are dining at at time).
- OtherBusinessClose : Mandate to fully close operations of any category of business. Coding a case as an other business closure requires the executive order to use phrasing indicative of a mandate (e.g., ""casinos must close"", ""operations at fitness centers and entertainment venues must cease by date""). A given state may have multiple cases of other business closures as they often occurred in phases (e.g., fitness centers and gyms on March 13, 2020; casinos and entertainment venues on March 15, 2020; personal service businesses like barbers and nail salons on March 19, 2020); thus, where possible, separate entries are provided for each mandate.
- NEBusinessClose : Mandate to close all non-essential businesses. Coding a case as a closure order requires the executive order to use phrasing indicative of a mandate (e.g., ""non-essential businesses are required to close"", ""non-essential businesses must cease operations by date""). Coding does not distinguish among states' classification of essential versus non-essential businesses, as they vary substantially by state.
- StayAtHome : Mandate for individuals to stay at home for all non-essential activities. Coding a case as a stay-at-home order mandate requires the executive order to using phrasing indicative of a mandate (e.g., ""must stay at home""); otherwise it is coded as 0 for the ""Mandate"" variable if it uses advisory phrasing. Coding does not distinguish among states' classification of essential versus non-essential activities, as they vary substantially by state. Shelter-in-place and stay-at-home orders are considered to be equivalent.
- Quarantine : Quarantines mandated for people entering the state, requiring a period of self-isolation. Quarantines may be imposed on all people entering the state, out-of-state residents, or travelers from a particular state or city. Quarantine length and who is covered by the policy can be found in the ""PolicyNotes"" variable. This policy type was added April 3, 2020.
- TravelRestrictIntra : Restrictions on travel within the state. These restrictions can be between cities or counties or within them. The ""StateWide"" variable reflects whether these restrictions are applicable to across the state (coded as 1) or only for local areas (coded as 0). This policy type was added April 3, 2020.
- TravelRestrictExit : Policies which prohibit residents of a state from leaving the state. These policies may have exceptions for essential businesses. This policy type was added April 3, 2020.
- TravelRestrictEntry : Travel restriction mandates that limit non-residents from entering a given state. These policies may have exceptions or exemptions for essential businesses or their employees, and they may include restrictions for commercial lodging for non-residents. This policy type was added April 8, 2020.
- CaseIsolation : Policy that requires individuals with confirmed COVID-19 infection (via testing) or suspected COVID-19 infection to self-isolate for a specified period of time, or when they no longer test positive for infection. This policy type may also include requirements for quarantine of individuals who have been identified as high-risk for developing COVID-19 due to their close contact to patients with confirmed or suspected infections, including sharing the same residence. This policy type is different from ""Quarantine"" in this dataset, which refers to policies that require self-quarantine for individuals entering a state from any or particular points of origin. This policy type was added April 25, 2020.
- PublicMask : Policy that requires individuals to wear masks or other mouth and nose coverings when they are outside their places of residence in the public. This policy type does not reflect requirements around mask use or other types of personal protective equipment mandated as part of business operations, either routine or under efforts to ease distancing policies to re-establish in-person operations of business establishments. This policy type was added April 25, 2020.
- BusinessHealthSafety : Policies or government-developed guidelines involving specific types of social distancing, sanitation and hygiene, disinfectant and cleaning, and employee protocols (e.g., temperature checks and symptom screenings before shifts start, use of cloth facial coverings during shifts, requirements for employees if they are ill) above and beyond standard business and health safety requirements for a given industry. These policies or protocols are often instituted in relation to easing prior business restrictions, and such easing of restrictions depends on the existence and adherence to these protocols. Subsequently, ""BusinessHealthSafety"" is often a policy that is linked via ""Depends"" for easing various restrictions. This variable was added on May 2, 2020.

Subsequently, ""BusinessHealthSafety"" is often a policy that is linked via ""Depends"" for easing various restrictions. This variable was added on May 2, 2020. Mandate : Binary variable indicating whether the policy applied is a mandate (1) or is advisory or a recommendation (0). This is coded on the basis of the order's phrasing (e.g., ""residents are advised to stay at home and avoid unnecessary travel"" would be coded as 0 for mandate as a ""StayAtHome"" policy).

This usually means that the previous policy will be in effect beyond its previous expiry date. An example: AK0004, a restaurant restriction in Alaska, was issued on 20200317, enacted 20200318, and had an initial expiry date of 20200401. AK0020, which was issued on 20200327 and enacted on 20200328, has AK0004 under the ""Extends"" variable, reflecting that this policy is extended until the DateExpiry listed for AK0020 (20200411). If (or when in this case) AK0020 is extended by a new order, AK0020 would be listed on that policy's ""Extends"" (which was AK0033). This variable was added on May 2, 2020.

Expands : Policy id (PID) that a new mandate or policy expands. This can mean different types of expansions: a policy now covers more populations or locations (e.g., expanding a local stay-at-home order to being statewide); a policy now includes a longer list of business types that must close in-person operations; a policy is now a mandate versus recommendations; and so on. This variable was added on May 2, 2020.

This variable was added on May 2, 2020. Eases : Policy id (PID) that a new mandate or policy eases. This means that while a previous policy is not fully ended yet, its earlier restrictions or mandates are no longer as strong. This could involve relaxing bans on mass gatherings (e.g., now groups of 25 or more are prohibited, versus 10); easing closure mandates on certain types of businesses so that they can limited in-person services (e.g., only up to 50% capacity); moving a stay-at-home order to a recommendation versus mandate; allowing some in-person instruction to occur for certain schools; and so on. As we code more policies that ease restrictions, we anticipate this variable to be refined further and we will document updates accordingly. This variable was added on May 2, 2020.

With the number of cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by this coronavirus, growing rapidly in the United States and around the world, the World Health Organization declared it a pandemic on March 11, 2020.

This page outlines state budget legislation to prepare for and respond to the coronavirus through supplemental appropriations, rainy day fund transfers and economic measures.
Federal Action
On March 18, the Families First Coronavirus Aid Package was signed into law. The bill includes free virus testing for those who are uninsured, emergency paid sick leave, expanded family and medical leave programs, unemployment assistance, food aid and federal funding for Medicaid.
President Donald Trump declared a national emergency on March 13 in response to the coronavirus epidemic. The declaration allows the administration to use the Stafford Act, a federal law governing disaster-relief efforts. The declaration is expected to make $50 billion in emergency funding available to states and territories.
The emergency declaration follows an $8.3 billion emergency coronavirus aid package signed by the president on March 6. At least $1.05 billion of the previous aid package will go to state, local and tribal efforts through grants and cooperative agreements with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention or as reimbursements from the federal government. The initial federal aid package was focused largely on public health concerns. To learn more about congressional appropriation to states, check out this NCSL Blog.
A third phase of federal coronavirus relief, the Coronavirus, Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act, was signed into law on March 27. The relief package allocates an estimated $2.2 trillion to battle the harmful effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. The package is the biggest fiscal stimulus package in modern American history. State and local governments will receive $150 billion, through the Coronavirus Relief Fund, to help them fund the unanticipated costs of fighting the pandemic. Additionally, the bill establishes a $500 lending fund for businesses, states and cities. Eligible taxpayers will receive s a $1,200 direct payment and $500 for each dependent child. To learn more about the CARES stimulus package, check out NCSL's summary.
For more information on the $150 billion Coronavirus Relief Fund (the ""Fund""), the U.S. Department of Treasury issued guidance for how state and local governments may spend the Fund. The Department of Treasury also posed an Frequently Asked Questions.
A $484 billion, Paycheck Protection Program and Health Care Enhancement Act, or ""phase 3.5"" coronavirus federal relief package was signed into law on April 24. The package provides $310 billion in funding to replenish the Small Business Administration's Paycheck Protection Program, which ran out of funding a few weeks after the program was initially created through the CARES Act. Additionally, the measure includes $75 billion for hospitals, $25 billion for COVID-19 testing, and $60 billion for emergency disaster loans and grants. For more information on the latest relief package check out NCSL's recent blog.
State Action
Legislatures are moving quickly to ensure agencies and local governments have the funds to prepare and respond to the coronavirus outbreak. Several states have enacted legislation that either appropriates additional funding for coronavirus-related tasks or authorizes a transfer of funds from the state's rainy day fund. Below is a chart outlining state budget legislation in response to COVID-19. To learn more about enacted state budget legislation in response to COVID-19, check out this NCSL Blog.

K-12 Education
In response to the spread of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), governors and legislatures have called for the statewide closure of at least 124,000 public schools in 48 states and every U.S. territory. (Map: Coronavirus and School Closures ‚Äì Education Week)
School Meals
While school closures may be necessary to slow the spread of the virus, they can adversely affect both parents, who might have to take off work to care for their child, as well as students, particularly low-income students, who rely on school meals for lunch. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) announced flexibilities to ensure that students receive meal service during school closures while minimizing potential exposure to the novel coronavirus. The USDA has issued waivers to exempt states from the congregate meal requirement as they develop customized strategies to respond to their population's needs. This will allow schools to leverage their participation in one of the USDA's summer meal programs.
Accountability
On March 12, 2020, the U.S. Department of Education (ED) announced that it would consider targeted one-year waivers on assessment and accountability requirements that could be impacted by the COVID-19 outbreak. Waivers could relax state assessment requirements and identification of low-performing schools if schools are closed for a significant portion of the year. The ED would also consider waiving the 95% testing participation rate and measures of chronic absenteeism.
On March 20, 2020, Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos announced the Department will grant a waiver to any state that is unable to assess its students due to the ongoing national emergency, providing relief from federally mandated testing requirements for this school year. Any state that receives this waiver may also receive a waiver from the requirement that this testing data be used in the statewide accountability system due to the national emergency .
By April 1, 2020, the ED had granted waivers of federal testing requirements for all 50 states, Washington, D.C., Puerto Rico, and the Bureau of Indian Education. These waivers provide state education agencies with the flexibility to bypass assessment and accountability requirements in the Every Student Succeeds Act for the 2019‚Äì2020 school year.
Instructional Time
The ED released a Q&A on providing services to students with disabilities during the COVID-19 outbreak. Per the guidance, if a school district does not provide general instruction due to COVID-19, schools are not required to provide services to students with disabilities during that time. If general instruction is offered during school closure, districts must ensure that students with disabilities also have equal access to the same opportunities as general education students. If a student with disabilities is homebound due to COVID-19 infection, schools must continue to provide educational services to the student.
While virtual or remote instruction can replace in-person instruction, it is important to note the limitations of this practice . Many students lack access to the technology needed to learn remotely. A study from the Associated Press found that 17% of U.S. students do not have computers in the home and 18% of students lack access to high-speed internet.
College Readiness
The outbreak has also disrupted the admissions process related to testing, the next scheduled nationwide tests of both the ACT and SAT have been cancelled. The CollegeBoard which administers the SAT, cancelled the May 2 test as well as the makeup test for earlier cancellations in March, students who registered for the test will receive refunds. The ACT postponed its April 4 test date to June 13. The CollegeBoard has also announced plans to allow students to take Advanced Placement (AP) tests from home. ETS, which administers the GRE has also announced an at-home version of the exam will be available to students who wish to take the test for graduate and professional schools. Because of disruptions in testing, several schools have announced plans to remove ACT/SAT requirements for admissions and become test-optional.

Election officials and policymakers are giving full attention to possible mitigation strategies. These include reviewing their state‚Äôs continuity of government constitutional provisions, continuity of legislatures during emergencies plans, election emergency statutes and election contingency plans at the state and local levels. On contingency planning, the National Association of Secretaries of State released State Laws & Practices for the Emergency Management of Elections in 2017.
The goal is to address both the practical and legal questions around running elections while also decreasing the potential for spreading the virus. Much of the responsibility lies with local jurisdictions or the executive branch. However, policymakers are thinking ahead as well. Legislation is just beginning to be introduced to address how elections can be well-executed even as public gatherings are discouraged in many locations. See the Legislative Action, Executive Action and State Election Official Action sections on state responses to COVID-19 and elections, along with Policy Options at the bottom of the page.

Policy Options
As legislators work to ensure fair elections in times of public health emergencies, they may look for policy options. NCSL does not recommend legislative changes or provide opinions on policy options. Instead, we have gathered ideas that have surfaced in response to the COVID-19 pandemic:
Review your state‚Äôs existing election emergency statutes. NCSL's Election Emergencies resource provides citations by state. In general, these laws either allow elections to be delayed or rescheduled, or for polling places to be relocated. Some explicitly give the governor the authority to change the election date. Most do not, yet governors are likely to have broad authority under general emergency management declarations which could include changing dates.
Some states request, or require, that local election authorities provide contingency plans to the state. The chief election officer may provide guidance to the local authorities.
Many states are planning for an increase in the use of absentee, or mail, ballots. In preparation, they may want to clarify how absentee voting works: Are requirements for witness signatures (in addition to the voter‚Äôs signature) required? What is the deadline for requesting a ballot, and does it need to be extended? When must completed ballots be received? When can ballot processing begin? States coud also review their capacity to tabulate larger numbers of absentee ballots, and more. See NCSL‚Äôs Voting Outside the Polling Place report, and particularly the section, Policy Decision Points.
In states where a voter must provide a reason to vote absentee, often there is a list of accepted reasons. This list could be expanded either through an interpretation of existing provisions that allow absentee voting for health reasons (Alabama's secretary of state has made it clear that anyone who has self-quarantined can apply for an absentee ballot), or through a legislative change to add a public health risk as an acceptable reason. See NCSL‚Äôs Voting Outside the Polling Place report, and particularly the section, Qualifying for an Absentee Ballot, to review accepted reasons for requesting an absentee ballot.
When polling places are located in long term care facilities, moving them to locations with fewer vulnerable people may make sense. State laws often require that notice of polling place changes be provided two or three months in advance. Does this require a change in law, or can a relocation be done with emergency authority?
Review provisional ballot laws. It is possible that voters might not be able to get to their designated polling place but might turn up at an election office or polling place elsewhere in the state. Would a ballot voted for just the statewide or applicable races count?
Poll workers may not be as willing to serve due to health risks, which can make running an election more challenging. Moving to consolidated polling places‚Äîin which several precincts vote at the same location‚Äîor moving to vote centers‚Äîin which any voter from a jurisdiction can vote at any polling place, usually a larger facility‚Äîcan reduce the total number of poll workers required.
In many states, people with disabilities have the option to use curbside voting; bipartisan teams of poll workers bring a ballot or ballot marking device to the car so the voter does not have to come inside. This option could be expanded.
Shelter-in-place orders and social distancing guidelines may make it difficult to collect signatures for candidate and initiative petitions. States may consider expanding various ballot measure and candidate filing deadlines.

These NPIs are targeted at the novel coronavirus. This data is collected by hand with reference to government health websites and local news media reports.

4-16-2020 Update
On 4-16-2020, we pushed a complete update, including reformating of the data. The data now includes all US states and territories and all counties with at least 100 confirmed cases as of 4/06/2020, according to JHU, for a total of over 380 localities.
The data has been reformatted to have each locality's policy on a single row, including a start and end date. Since policies are still in place, no end dates have been recorded yet. This includes places where end dates have been announced, as we anticipate that there is a strong likliehood of those dates being extended.
We have also changed the defined categories to focus more on explicit government orders and less on recommendations. This helps us collect more uniform data across the 300+ localities. We have removed social distancing of a portion of the population, added shelter in place, re-defined social distancing as physical distance(6ft) between people, and added a relgious gathering cancellation indicator.
There are two available sheets: a raw sheet of policies and an inherited sheet of policies. The raw sheet includes only policies ordered by that level of government; it would not capture a state policy applying to a county that has not issued its own order, even though the state policy is in effect in the county. The inherited level does capture this, having county policy start_dates tied to the state policy start date if either a) the county did not issue a policy of that type and the state did that applied to that county. or b) the county issued a policy after the state issued a policy applying to that county.
NPIs Included
The NPIs defined are: ‚Ä¢ social_distancing - Social Distancing mandate of at least 6 feet between people
‚Ä¢ shelter_in_place - An order indicating that people should shelter in their homes except for essential reasons
‚Ä¢ gathering_size_XX_to_YY - Gathering size limitation, with the digits indicating the ceiling of acceptable gatherings. A government order indicating that gatherings above that size are prohibited
‚Ä¢ closing_of_public_venues - Closure of Public Venues. A government order closing gathering venues for in-person service, such as restaurants, bars, and theaters
‚Ä¢ school_closure - Closure of schools and universities
‚Ä¢ non_essential_services_closure - Non-Essential Services Closure, i.e. a government order closing non-essential services and shops
‚Ä¢ lockdown ‚Äì Lock Down (pending)
‚Ä¢ religious_gathering_cancellation ‚Äì Cancelling of religious gatherings, either explicitly or implicitly by applying gathering size / shelter-in-place limitations to religious gatherings as well.

Community mitigation activities (also referred to as nonpharmaceutical interventions) are actions that persons and communities can take to slow the spread of infectious diseases. Mitigation strategies include personal protective measures (e.g., handwashing, cough etiquette, and face coverings) that persons can use at home or while in community settings; social distancing (e.g., maintaining physical distance between persons in community settings and staying at home); and environmental surface cleaning at home and in community settings, such as schools or workplaces. Actions such as social distancing are especially critical when medical countermeasures such as vaccines or therapeutics are not available. Although voluntary adoption of social distancing by the public and community organizations is possible, public policy can enhance implementation. The CDC Community Mitigation Framework (1) recommends a phased approach to implementation at the community level, as evidence of community spread of disease increases or begins to decrease and according to severity. This report presents initial data from the metropolitan areas of San Francisco, California; Seattle, Washington; New Orleans, Louisiana; and New York City, New York* to describe the relationship between timing of public policy measures, community mobility (a proxy measure for social distancing), and temporal trends in reported coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases. Community mobility in all four locations declined from February 26, 2020 to April 1, 2020, decreasing with each policy issued and as case counts increased. This report suggests that public policy measures are an important tool to support social distancing and provides some very early indications that these measures might help slow the spread of COVID-19.
When a novel virus with pandemic potential emerges, community mitigation strategies often are the most readily available interventions to slow transmission. CDC-recommended community mitigation interventions for COVID-19, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, are based on evidence for other viral respiratory illnesses and emerging data on SARS-CoV-2 transmission and epidemiology, including groups at highest risk for hospitalization and death from COVID-19 (1,2).
Public policies to implement social distancing include emergency declarations, bans on gatherings of certain sizes, school closures, restrictions on businesses, and stay-at-home or shelter-in-place of residence orders. These strategies can substantially disrupt daily life; therefore, the intensity of their implementation should align with progression and severity of disease (1). Understanding the timing and potential impact of policies designed to increase compliance with mitigation strategies will assist in guiding modification of those policies over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic as well as increasing the understanding of when and how to fully implement these strategies in future outbreaks where community mitigation is required.
Data from February 26‚ÄìApril 1, 2020 were examined from the core metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) of Seattle, San Francisco, and New Orleans, and from the five boroughs of New York City (3). These areas were selected because each had substantial numbers of reported COVID-19 cases during the early stages of the U.S. epidemic (4). For each locality, the following data were analyzed: 1) types and timing of public policies issued to promote community mitigation interventions at the national, state, and local government levels; 2) cumulative number of reported COVID-19 cases; 3) average 3-day percentage change in reported cases; and 4) community mobility.
The types and timing of public policies issued were collected by using Google Alerts and targeted Google searches for news media coverage of state and local COVID-19 orders and proclamations, followed by searching state, county, parish, and city government websites to locate official copies of each order. Confirmed cumulative COVID-19 case count data were collected from USAFacts (4), which aggregates data on cases by date of report from CDC and state- and local-level public health agencies. The 3-day average percentage change in cumulative case count was calculated after the cumulative case count was >20 and is presented to describe more completely the trend in the epidemic growth rate. Community mobility was defined as the percentage of personal mobile devices (e.g., mobile phones, tablets, and watches) leaving home, using publicly accessible data from SafeGraph, a data company that aggregates anonymized location data from mobile devices (5). The percentage leaving home measure is the inverse of the SafeGraph ‚Äúcompletely home‚Äù metric, an indicator that a device has not moved throughout the day beyond approximately 150 m (492 ft) of its common nighttime location. The average number of devices included in daily reporting was 80,095 in New Orleans (6.4% of population); 336,783 devices in New York City (4.0% of population); 163,981 devices in San Francisco (3.6% of population); and 177,027 devices in Seattle (4.8% of population).
In each of the four locations, a combination of state and local community mitigation policies was issued (Table). All four metropolitan areas were in states that declared a state of emergency and put local limits on mass gatherings, although these varied by numbers of people allowed and, in some cases, changed over time. All four issued school closure and stay-at-home orders at state or local levels, and three parishes in the New Orleans MSA were the only areas in this study to implement a curfew.
In addition to state and local policies, which were implemented beginning in March, on March 16, 2020, the White House announced the 15 Days to Slow the Spread guidelines for persons to take action to reduce the spread of COVID-19. This national action was extended for an additional 30 days on March 30, 2020.‚Ä†
Timing of community mitigation policies in relation to the increasing cumulative case counts of COVID-19 varied by locality (Figure). In all four metropolitan areas, an emergency declaration was the first policy issued, before large increases in cumulative cases. Stay-at-home orders were the last mitigation policy to be issued in all areas except for the New Orleans MSA, where a curfew in three of eight parishes was issued after the stay-at-home order. In all four metropolitan areas, the percentage of residents leaving home declined as the number of policies issued increased (Figure); in all four localities the percentage leaving home was close to 80% on February 26, and by April 1 the percentage leaving home was 42% in New York City, 47% in San Francisco, 52% in Seattle, and 61% in New Orleans. Overall, across the four areas, emergency declarations (the first policies issued) did not result in a sustained change in mobility; however, declines in mobility occurred after implementation of combinations of policies (such as limits on gatherings or school closures) and after the White House 15 Days to Slow the Spread guidelines were implemented. There were additional declines in mobility following stay-at-home orders in all four locations. The average 3-day percentage change also varied by locality, with some variation across the four metropolitan areas during the first two weeks of March, followed by a decline and leveling in the last two weeks of March. These changes also follow the issuance of a set of policies and rapid decline in mobility mid-March.",['Arielle Lasry'],2020-04-16 00:00:00

Finding virus carriers‚Äîespecially those with no symptoms‚Äîis among the biggest hurdles to addressing the pandemic.
But what if dogs can do that? Scientists in London say that dogs could in fact revolutionize the hunt for Covid-19 by sniffing out subtle odors produced by the virus when within the human body. The London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine is crowdfunding a project to train canines to detect healthy-seeming people who haven‚Äôt necessarily realized yet they are carriers. If the project is successful, the animal detectives could be working across Britain by the summer.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs very early stages,‚Äù says James Logan, head of LSHTM‚Äôs Department of Disease Control. ‚ÄúWe know diseases have odors ‚Äî including respiratory diseases such as influenza ‚Äî and that those odors are in fact quite distinct. There is a very, very good chance that Covid-19 has a specific odor, and if it does I am really confident that the dogs would be able to learn that smell and detect it.‚Äù
Dogs with a highly developed sense of smell are already used to diagnose many medical conditions, including Parkinson‚Äôs disease and several types of cancer. The LSHTM itself has already trained up animals‚Äîlabradors and cocker spaniels tend to be especially suited‚Äîto detect malaria. Their success rate far exceeds required WHO standards, the center says.
If the project works, the dogs could be deployed to screen staff at hospitals and care homes and, once regular travel resumes, sniff out unwitting carriers at airports and rail stations. Capable of screening thousands of people per day, the dogs could be a key tool for getting daily life back to normal quickly and safely.","[""Feargus O'Sullivan""]",2020-04-16 12:15:08

""You are going to call your own shots,"" Trump said, according to a person familiar with the conversation. ""I've gotten to know almost all of you, most of you I've known and some very well. You are all very capable people, I think in all cases, very capable people. And you're going to be calling your shots.""
It was a turnabout from his Monday claim that ""the President of the United States calls the shots"" in how to ease restrictions that have kept most Americans indoors and forced closures of schools, restaurants, gyms and other businesses. And it was an indication that even as he tries to ease the country out of its virtual shutdown, Trump will place responsibility elsewhere should cases spike again.
As business leaders, lawmakers and governors warn persistent testing shortfalls could hamper any effort to reopen the country, Trump is pushing ahead with attempts to revive an economy moribund by the coronavirus pandemic. He said during his daily news conference the new guidelines amount to the start of the country's ""rejuvenation.""
""We're starting our life again,"" Trump said, even as it remains to be seen just how quickly any state returns to normal.
The new guidelines , meant to speed Trump's goal of restarting the country, won't be mandatory. Many governors have already extended restrictions into May or banded into regional collectives that will determine their own reopening plans. The newest consortium was created in the Midwest on Thursday by Democratic and Republican governors.
But Trump, eager to see a return to normalcy for housebound Americans, wants to provide at least a framework for how places can reopen despite warnings from all corners that testing capacity for coronavirus is still too small.
He said Thursday there were some states that, according to his new plan, could be ready to reopen tomorrow.
""If you look at Montana, Wyoming, North Dakota -- that's a lot different than New York, it's a lot different than New Jersey,"" Trump said.
New guidelines
In a document provided to all 50 US governors during an afternoon phone call and obtained by CNN, the White House spelled out a three-phase approach to easing restrictions that depends on meeting specific case count and hospital capacity thresholds.
The benchmarks for the first phase include a sustained decrease in cases over a 14-day period and a return to pre-crisis conditions in hospitals, according to the document.
States should have the ""ability to quickly set up safe and efficient screening and testing sites,"" the guidelines read, and ""quickly and independently supply sufficient Personal Protective Equipment"" in hospitals.
The phased approach encourages all individuals to continue good hygiene practices like washing hands and to ""strongly consider"" using face coverings in public. And the document encourages employers to enact social distancing, temperature checks, testing and sanitation practices in their workplaces.
In the first phase of reopening, the document suggests schools that are currently closed should remain so and employees who are able to telework should keep working from home.
Large venues, including some restaurants, can operate under strict social distancing protocols. Gyms can open as long as they maintain social distancing guidelines, but bars should remain shuttered.
The guidelines still recommend minimizing nonessential travel, and indicate vulnerable populations should remain sheltered-in-place.
Phases two and three gradually decrease the recommended restrictions.
Trump unveiled the guidelines publicly at an early evening news conference.
""We are not opening all at once but one careful step at a time,"" Trump said, indicating each state could ""tailor"" its own reopening plan. ""If they need to remain closed, we will allow them to do that.""
In his call with governors, Trump previewed the plan but insisted it would be up to the individual governors to make the decision in their own states when they begin that process.
Trump said the decision to target May 1 as the day to begin the process of reopening the country came in consultation with Drs. Anthony Fauci and Deborah Birx , medical leaders of the administration's coronavirus task force.
Trump described the two doctors' sign-off on May 1 date as a ""negotiation.""
""It was a little bit of a negotiation that that's the way it should be,"" Trump said. ""I guess, I hope it is that way usually, but we all do want to see things open.""
Birx described the guidelines as ""fairly strict"" in order to give states time to get testing and surveillance ready.
""That's to give states really the time to really set up exactly how they're going to contact trace with the (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) in the background as supporting,"" Birx said on CNN's Global Town Hall, ""Coronavirus: Facts and Fears.""
""I think those two pieces together, we really need to move forward over the next few weeks as the states move through, and really decrease the number of cases.""
'Absolute authority' turns into not mandatory
Ahead of their release, officials said the new recommendations would mimic the social distancing guidelines the President announced in March and extended at the start of April: While not mandatory, they carry the weight of the federal government and the presidency.
Trump, who began the week insisting he had the ""absolute authority"" to reopen the country, retreated after pushback from Republican and Democratic governors alike. He said each state would submit a plan to him for reopening, though even that is not required.
Many states have already begun drafting plans on returning to normal, including consortia of states on the East and West coasts that have agreed on joint phased reopenings.
Ahead of Trump's phone call with governors on Thursday, a new collective of Midwestern governors said they were joining together to coordinate on reopening plans. The leaders of Michigan, Ohio, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Illinois, Indiana and Kentucky -- both Democrats and Republicans -- said they would ""work in close coordination to reopen our economies in a way that prioritizes our workers' health.""
Many of those governors -- along with public health experts, lawmakers and business leaders -- say that without widespread testing, Americans won't be able to return to workplaces quickly because it will remain unclear who could still be spreading the virus.
In phone calls with members of the US House and Senate on Thursday, Trump was told by some lawmakers that without increased testing, asymptomatic people may return to workplaces and unknowingly spread further contagion, according to people familiar with the call.
Trump countered by saying his administration had worked to scale up testing and he repeated his dubious claim that the United States had tested more people than any other country.
He also pointed to a new test that people could administer themselves that uses saliva, a person familiar with the conversation said.
It was a similar message to one he received a day earlier during a phone call with some members of his newly formed business advisory council. In that conversation, industry leaders reiterated what public health experts and governors have been telling Trump for weeks: that there would need to be guarantees of ramped-up coronavirus testing before people return to work, according to one person briefed on the discussions.
As they weigh new guidelines on reopening the country, White House officials have pored over data on testing availability and hospital capacity, hoping to more narrowly devise a strategy to improve testing capacity where it still lags.
Trump said Wednesday it was governors' responsibility to improve testing in their state, shrugging off responsibility for enacting the type of nationwide testing system he was touting only last month.
""We want the states to administer these tests, for the most part,"" he said. ""We want them to do it, we're not going to be running a parking lot in Arkansas.""
Different regional rules
Birx, the White House coronavirus response coordinator, said Wednesday there were nine states with fewer than 1,000 cases each who may be the first to lift distancing restrictions. Trump said he believed there could be nearly 30 states in ""extremely good shape,"" and repeated his assertion that certain places may be able to reopen sooner than May 1.
But even among the nine states with the lowest case counts -- Maine, Vermont, West Virginia, Nebraska, North Dakota, Montana, Wyoming, Alaska and Hawaii -- not all governors have expressed an eagerness to quickly reopen. Some, such as North Dakota, still appear to be experiencing an increase in cases, meaning their peaks could be weeks away.
Before Trump unveiled the new guidelines, he spent the day on phone calls with foreign leaders and lawmakers. In a teleconference with other G7 leaders, Trump faced resistance to his decision to halt US funding to the World Health Organization.
Trump has claimed the WHO is overly weighted toward China and made grave mistakes early in the coronavirus outbreak, a stance he reiterated on the morning videoconference. But other leaders, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, sought to bolster the global health body as essential during the pandemic.

(Thomas Peter/Reuters)
U.S. officials warned in January 2018 that the Wuhan Institute of Virology‚Äôs work on ‚ÄúSARS-like coronaviruses in bats,‚Äù combined with ‚Äúa serious shortage‚Äù of proper safety procedures, could result in human transmission and the possibility of a ‚Äúfuture emerging coronavirus outbreak.‚Äù
In a series of diplomatic cables, one of which was obtained by The Washington Post‚Äôs Josh Rogin, U.S. Embassy officials warned their superiors that the lab, which they had visited several times, posed a serious health risk that warranted U.S. intervention. The officials were concerned enough about their findings to categorize the communications as ‚ÄúSensitive But Unclassified,‚Äù in order to keep them out of the public eye.

‚ÄúDuring interactions with scientists at the WIV laboratory, they noted the new lab has a serious shortage of appropriately trained technicians and investigators needed to safely operate this high-containment laboratory,‚Äù the cable reads.
‚ÄúThe cable was a warning shot,‚Äù one U.S. official told Rogin. ‚ÄúThey were begging people to pay attention to what was going on.‚Äù
While China has stated the virus emerged from a seafood market in Wuhan, U.S. officials are skeptical of the claim, with National Review detailing how the Wuhan Institute of Virology posted jobs in November and December of last year to show how they had been working on ‚Äúlong-term research on the pathogenic biology of bats carrying important viruses,‚Äù which had ‚Äúconfirmed the origin of bats of major new human and livestock infectious diseases‚Äù in December.

‚ÄúThe idea that is was just a totally natural occurrence is circumstantial. The evidence it leaked from the lab is circumstantial. Right now, the ledger on the side of it leaking from the lab is packed with bullet points and there‚Äôs almost nothing on the other side,‚Äù a U.S. official told Rogin.

The Wuhan Institute of Virology is China‚Äôs first laboratory to achieve the highest level of international bioresearch safety, known as BSL-4. But its work on bats ‚Äî led by Shi Zhengli, the Chinese virologist nicknamed ‚ÄúBat Woman‚Äù for her work with that species ‚Äî is conducted at the lower protection level of BSL-2.
The 2018 cable confirms that Shi ‚Äî whose team published research in November 2017 revealing that horseshoe bats they had collected from a cave in Yunnan province were very likely from the same bat population that spawned the SARS outbreak of 2002-2003 ‚Äî was then working on ‚ÄúSARS-like coronaviruses.‚Äù Shi‚Äôs team was also the first to reveal in February that the new outbreak was a bat-derived coronavirus.

‚ÄúMost importantly, the researchers also showed that various SARS-like coronaviruses can interact with ACE2, the human receptor identified for SARS-coronavirus. This finding strongly suggests that SARS-like coronaviruses from bats can be transmitted to humans to cause SARS-like diseases,‚Äù the cable states. ‚ÄúFrom a public health perspective, this makes the continued surveillance of SARS-like coronaviruses in bats and study of the animal-human interface critical to future emerging coronavirus outbreak prediction and prevention.‚Äù

Multiple reports have detailed how China is blocking U.S. researchers from information about the virus, including live samples of the virus needed to develop a vaccine.
‚ÄúThey didn‚Äôt make the virus available to anyone,‚Äù former FDA Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb told National Review editor Rich Lowry. ‚Äù . . . They didn‚Äôt make the live virus available. The United States eventually got the live virus, but they got it weeks later than they otherwise could have, and that delayed development of diagnostic tests.‚Äù
On Monday, Beijing issued a new set of guidelines about Chinese reporting on the origins of the coronavirus outbreak, stating that ‚Äúacademic papers about tracing the origin of the virus must be strictly and tightly managed.‚Äù

79,3f155d0a-a2b5-405f-8b6a-2b34590c2893,aaron,https://www.livescience.com/coronavirus-covid-19-risk-and-smoking.html,Why COVID-19 hits smokers harder,"Smokers may be prone to severe COVID-19 infections, in part, because their lungs contain an abundance of entry points that the virus can exploit.
COVID-19 infections begin at the ACE2 receptor , a protein nestled on the surface of cells throughout the body, including in the upper and lower respiratory tracts. The coronavirus that causes COVID-19, known as SARS-CoV-2, must plug into the ACE2 receptor in order to inject its genetic material into cells, replicate and spread. Now, preliminary research suggests that lungs exposed to cigarette smoke accumulate abnormally large numbers of ACE2 receptors, which may leave the organ vulnerable to damage inflicted by the coronavirus.
""It has been reported that smokers who get COVID-19 tend to have more severe infections than individuals who aren‚Äôt smokers,"" co-author Jason Sheltzer, a research fellow at the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in New York, told Live Science in an email. An increase in ACE2 receptors ""could be one reason ‚Äî of many ‚Äî why smokers get so sick from coronavirus,"" he said.
The study, posted March 31 to the preprint database bioRxiv , has not been peer-reviewed and its premise remains ""fairly speculative,"" said Dr. Stephanie Christenson, an assistant professor in the Division of Pulmonary, Critical Care, Allergy, and Sleep Medicine at University of California, San Francisco, who was not involved in the study.
""If ACE2 expression is high, if ACE2 expression is low, and what that means toward your overall prognosis ‚Äî I don't think we actually know that yet,"" Christenson told Live Science.
""Smoking does a lot of things to the body,"" Sheltzer added. ""And it‚Äôs possible that [smoking's] effect on ACE2 levels isn‚Äôt the most important factor.""
Smoking linked to severe infection
Mounting evidence suggests that, compared with nonsmokers, people who smoke cigarettes face a higher risk of developing severe complications and dying from COVID-19 infections.
For instance, a study of more than 1,000 patients in China, published in the New England Journal of Medicine , found that smokers with COVID-19 were more likely to require intensive medical interventions than those who didn't smoke. In the study, 12.3% of current smokers were admitted to an ICU, were placed on a ventilator or died, as compared with only 4.7% of nonsmokers.
Smokers may be particularly vulnerable to COVID-19 for several reasons, but the ACE2 receptor hypothesis ""provides a holistic, mechanistic link"" between smoking and severe infection, Jaber Alqahtani, a researcher in Respiratory Medicine at University College London, told Live Science in an email. If future research bolsters the link between receptor quantity and disease severity, drugs that block or reduce the sensitivity of ACE2 receptors could potentially be used as treatments, he added.

More gateways into the lung
To draw the connection between ACE2 receptors and smoking, Sheltzer and software engineer Joan Smith, a member of Sheltzer's lab, examined lung and respiratory tissue samples from deceased mice, rats and humans, as well as samples collected during human lung surgeries. The number of ACE2 receptors in the lungs did not vary between rodents of different ages or different sexes, and the same trends appeared in humans.
As age and sex appeared unrelated to ACE2 quantity, the researchers wondered if cigarette smoke exposure might make a difference.
The team inspected tissue samples from mice that had been exposed to diluted cigarette smoke for zero, 2, 3 or 4 hours a day over the course of five months. They found that, the more smoke exposure, the more ACE2 receptors studded the animals' lungs. Compared with unexposed mice, the mice that received the highest dose of cigarette smoke accumulated about 80% more ACE2 receptors in their lungs. The researchers then compared the lungs of human smokers against those who never smoked, and again, they found a similar trend: Smokers‚Äô lungs contained 40% to 50% more ACE2 receptors than those of nonsmokers.
The quantity of ACE2 receptors varied by pack-years ‚Äî a measure of how many packs of cigarettes a person smoked per day multiplied by the number of years the person smoked. For example, among smokers who had undergone thoracic surgery, people who smoked more than 80 pack-years showed a 100% increase in ACE2 receptors compared with people who smoked fewer than 20 pack-years, the authors noted.
While smoke-exposed tissues harbored more ACE2 receptors, the team could not tell which specific cells contained the receptor. By examining which proteins appeared in what cells, the team found that ACE2 appeared on cells that process oxygen and carbon dioxide in the lungs, known as alveolar type 2 cells. But primarily, the receptors appeared on cells that secrete a mucus-like fluid into the respiratory tracts, known as goblet and club cells. Nonsmokers carry most of their goblet and club cells in their nose and throat, but in smokers, the cells begin to accumulate also in the lungs, the authors found.
""What they're suggesting is that when you smoke you have an increase in goblet cells [in the lower respiratory tract], and that's definitely true,"" Christenson said.
Evidence that smoking boosts the number of secretory cells in the lungs has been reported for decades, according to a 1999 report in the American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine . The sticky mucus generated by goblet and club cells acts as a protective barrier, capturing debris, aerosols, smoke and pathogens that get sucked into the respiratory system, Christenson said. When people inhale smoke into their lungs, the organ reinforces its defenses by building more secretory cells and increasing mucus production. The same process occurs in individuals exposed to high levels of air pollution, Christenson said.
Still a hypothesis
While high numbers of goblet and club cells, laden with ACE2 receptors, may explain why smokers fall severely ill of COVID-19, the exact relationship between ACE2 and disease prognosis ""remains to be demonstrated,"" Sheltzer and Smith noted.
Smoking is associated with many comorbidities ‚Äî multiple medical conditions that appear simultaneously ‚Äî including emphysema and compromised immune function, which likely exacerbate COVID-19 infections, they wrote. In general, smokers already face a heightened risk of catching viral infections, likely due to their having depressed immune systems , tissue damage and chronic inflammation in the respiratory tracts, Christenson added.
High ACE2 levels may not be unique to smokers, but instead may be common among people with lung conditions, in general, the authors noted. The team did analyze tissue samples from patients with asthma and the inflammatory disease sarcoidosis, however, and these did not contain abnormal quantities of the receptor.
To tease out how ACE2 levels relate to lung disease, in general, future research could focus on patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ), bronchitis, pneumonia or lung diseases triggered by bacterial, viral or fungal infections, Alqahtani said. If they also have elevated levels of ACE2 receptors on their cells, that could help clarify whether cigarette smoke poses a singular threat to COVID-19 patients, or if other lung conditions present risks for the same reason.
If smoking does prove uniquely dangerous for COVID-19 patients, however, the study does offer a potential solution.
""We show that former smokers have lower levels of ACE2 than current smokers"" ‚Äî about 30% lower, Sheltzer said. ""It‚Äôs conceivable that quitting smoking could be beneficial to decrease COVID-19 susceptibility, for multiple reasons.""
""Indeed, it also allows us to consider campaigns and programs aimed at helping smokers quit as a preventative strategy going forward,"" Alqahtani added.",['Nicoletta Lanese'],2020-04-10 19:06:34

The Democratic Republic of Congo had on Monday hoped to declare an end to the country‚Äôs deadly 20-month-long Ebola epidemic. But in the run-up to the long-awaited deadline, the country reported two new Ebola deaths, a resurgence that comes as the country fights to stamp out the coronavirus.

Hopes had been high that the World Health Organisation (WHO) would on Monday officially bring the curtain down on the country‚Äôs 10th known outbreak of the notorious haemorrhagic fever.
But on Friday, a 26-year-old man was listed as having died from the disease, and on Sunday, health authorities reported that a young girl who had been treated in the same health centre in the northeastern city of Beni, an epicentre of the outbreak, had also passed away. On Monday, the WHO said another young girl who had visited the clinic had started showing Ebola infection symptoms.
The Ebola epidemic, which began in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo on August 1 2018, has claimed 2,276 lives, according to an official tally.
The outbreak can only be declared officially over after 52 days without any new cases, which is equal to twice the virus‚Äô incubation period.
The resurgence of the deadly virus means that DR Congo is now fighting two extremely infectious diseases, including also the deadly coronavirus.
‚ÄúMorally it‚Äôs very discouraging since we‚Äôve worked for a year and a half, two years, on this epidemic and [we could finally] start to breathe easy. Then suddenly we have to start from zero again. It's a psychological blow,"" Doctor Lusungu Mutuza told FRANCE 24.
Hosing down streets
In a bid to stamp out Covid-19, cleaners on Monday moved in to disinfect the institutional and commercial centre of Kinshasa, the epicentre of the country‚Äôs outbreak of the disease.
Cleaners clad in white suits deployed sprays and fumigators to deep-clean parliament, known as the Palace of the People, which is the seat of the National Assembly and Senate. Legislators are scheduled to gather in congress in the coming days.
Gombe, a district of embassies, corporate offices and upmarket homes next to Lingwala where the parliament is located, has been in lockdown since April 6.
Cleaners have ‚Äúdisinfected the building (in Gombe) where several ministerial cabinets are housed,‚Äù said Blaise Zahinda, a communications adviser for the environment ministry.
On Sunday, firemen hosed down the main streets of Gombe using water containing a five-percent solution of bleach.
The DRC, a country the size of continental western Europe, is considered by experts to be highly vulnerable to the spread of coronavirus.
It has a large population of 80 million, conflict in its east, crowded shantytowns in the capital and poor healthcare infrastructure.
The country has reported 235 cases of coronavirus, 20 of them fatal.
Infections have occurred in five out of the DRC‚Äôs 26 provinces, led by the city-province of Kinshasa, which accounts for 223 cases. Most of those infections have been in Gombe.

Unconventional policy options such as ‚Äòhelicopter money‚Äô should be on the table, they argue.
Governments will need to reduce personal and corporate bankruptcies, ensure people have money to keep spending even if they‚Äôre not working, and increase public investment and healthcare spending, the economists say.
As the list of countries shutting down in the face of the coronavirus pandemic continues to grow, leading economists from around the world are calling for radical action to fight the economic fallout.
More than 40 high-profile economists, including IMF Chief Economist Gita Gopinath and former President Barack Obama‚Äôs top economic adviser, Jason Furman, have contributed to an eBook from the Centre for Economic Policy Research (CEPR) in which they urge governments to act quickly and do whatever it takes to keep the lights on.
They advocate using heavy fiscal firepower for a ‚Äúwhatever-it-takes‚Äù economic response to the COVID-19 crisis.
Among the drastic measures proposed are: ‚Äòhelicopter money,‚Äô where everyone gets a no-strings-attached handout; Eurozone countries using eurobonds to issue debt together rather than individually; and state investment banks providing unlimited emergency lending to firms.
Flattening two curves

Though the economists say it‚Äôs still too early to tell how bad the economic damage will be, they‚Äôre certain it will be large ‚Äì the pandemic is destroying lives and livelihoods around the world.
The measures necessary to contain the virus ‚Äì quarantine, social distancing, school, university and daycare closures, shutdowns of non-essential businesses, and asking people to work from home ‚Äì are bringing economies to a screeching halt.
What is the World Economic Forum doing about the coronavirus outbreak? A new strain of Coronavirus, COVID 19, is spreading around the world, causing deaths and major disruption to the global economy. Responding to this crisis requires global cooperation among governments, international organizations and the business community, which is at the centre of the World Economic Forum‚Äôs mission as the International Organization for Public-Private Cooperation. The Forum has created the COVID Action Platform, a global platform to convene the business community for collective action, protect people‚Äôs livelihoods and facilitate business continuity, and mobilize support for the COVID-19 response. The platform is created with the support of the World Health Organization and is open to all businesses and industry groups, as well as other stakeholders, aiming to integrate and inform joint action. As an organization, the Forum has a track record of supporting efforts to contain epidemics. In 2017, at our Annual Meeting, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) was launched ‚Äì bringing together experts from government, business, health, academia and civil society to accelerate the development of vaccines. CEPI is currently supporting the race to develop a vaccine against this strand of the coronavirus.
‚ÄúWe are facing a joint health and economic crisis of unprecedented proportions in recent history,‚Äù writes Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas of the University of California, Berkeley, in a chapter on how to flatten both the infection and recession curves.
But there are fiscal policies governments can use to prevent or limit catastrophic collapses, which Gourinchas says are like the ‚Äúintensive care units, beds and ventilators of the economic system.‚Äù For example, central banks can provide emergency liquidity to the financial sector.
Reducing economic scar tissue

To avoid deep, long-lasting damage to economies, governments will need to reduce the number of personal and corporate bankruptcies, ensure people have money to keep spending even if they‚Äôre not working, and increase public investment and healthcare spending, the authors write.

‚ÄúA devil's choice.‚Äù That's how Seth Berkley, head of GAVI, the Vaccine Alliance, describes the dilemma facing global health organizations in the past few weeks. They could either continue to support mass vaccination campaigns in poor countries but risk that they would inadvertently help spread COVID-19‚Äîor recommend their suspension, inevitably triggering an upsurge of many other infectious diseases.
In the end, they chose the latter, and mass vaccination campaigns against a host of diseases are now grinding to a halt in many countries. For many children, these campaigns are the only chance to get vaccines. Some 13.5 million have already missed out on vaccinations for polio, measles, human papillomavirus, yellow fever, cholera, and meningitis since the suspensions began, Berkley says. ‚ÄúI tell you those numbers will be much larger than what we see today.‚Äù The fallout may last long after the pandemic subsides. And in the case of polio, the pause imperils the success of a 3-decade eradication campaign that was already in trouble.
The suspensions began on 24 March, when leaders of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) called on countries to postpone all polio vaccination campaigns until the second half of the year. The huge campaigns‚Äîdoor-to-door efforts that reach 400 million to 450 million annually‚Äîare the mainstay of the eradication program. Yet, ‚ÄúWe had no choice,‚Äù says Michel Zaffran of the World Health Organization (WHO), who heads GPEI. The vaccination drives would put both communities and frontline health workers at risk of infection with the coronavirus, he says. But he concedes more children will be paralyzed in countries where polio is still circulating, and the virus will likely spread to countries that are now polio-free.
The polio eradication effort is already reeling from setbacks in Afghanistan and Pakistan, where the wild virus is surging, and in Africa, where outbreaks caused by the live polio vaccine itself are spiraling out of control (Science, 3 January, p. 14). ‚ÄúEveryone was uncomfortable‚Äù with suspending campaigns, Zaffran says. But in the end, the only real tension among GPEI leaders was whether to call for a firm halt not only to preventive campaigns, but also to the targeted campaigns in response to the vaccine-derived outbreaks in Africa. Ultimately, ‚ÄúThe guidance came from a very high level to pause everything,‚Äù says Rebecca Martin of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). (GPEI's Polio Oversight Board is composed of the heads of all the partner agencies, including WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.) The program will reassess the decision every 2 weeks.
On 26 March, WHO's Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization (SAGE) issued a broader call, recommending that countries stop mass vaccination campaigns against all vaccine-preventable diseases. ‚ÄúAny mass campaigns would go against the idea of social distancing,‚Äù says Alejandro Cravioto of the National Autonomous University of Mexico's Faculty of Medicine, who chairs SAGE.
Twenty-three countries have already suspended their measles campaigns, and as a result, 78 million children will miss out on the vaccine, says Robb Linkins, a measles expert in CDC's Global Immunization Division. Sixteen other countries are still deciding. Linkins foresees ‚Äútragic‚Äù consequences. In poor countries, the virus can kill 3% to 6% of those it infects, WHO says, with malnourished children especially at risk. Measles infected an estimated 10 million and killed 140,000 in 2018, the last year for which numbers are complete. And because measles is incredibly contagious, case numbers could quickly surge following the suspensions.
Unlike the polio initiative, SAGE stopped short of recommending that countries halt campaigns to quell ongoing outbreaks, but it said they should carefully weigh the risk of an immediate response against that of a delayed one. For now, measles campaigns are continuing in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where the world's biggest outbreak has so far killed an estimated 6500 children‚Äîfar more than the recent Ebola outbreak in that country‚Äîand sickened more than 340,000.
WHO, GAVI, and other health organizations stress that routine immunization of individual children at clinics must continue as much as possible during the pandemic. But health systems in many countries were already stretched thin, and protective gear is often lacking. Berkley fears severe disruptions of routine immunization if health workers are diverted to COVID-19 or become sick or die, or if parents are afraid to bring their children to a clinic. Vaccines may run out as well. Some countries are already experiencing shortages as flights are grounded and borders close, Berkley says.
Other essential health services will also be disrupted, says Augustin Augier, executive director of the Alliance for International Medical Action. Every year, ALIMA trains about 500,000 African mothers to diagnose acute, potentially fatal malnutrition in their children; those programs have been suspended. The knock-on consequences of the pandemic ‚Äúwill be much stronger and more lethal for the world's most vulnerable populations,‚Äù Augier says.
Across all these programs, the goal is to come back hard and fast to regain lost ground once the pandemic is over. In the meantime, WHO says, countries should continue surveillance for vaccine-preventable diseases to figure out where pathogens are circulating and which children are most at risk. But that, too, is a challenge amid the fear and disruption from COVID-19.
Berkley sees some hope in the experience in West Africa after the 2014‚Äì15 Ebola outbreak. ‚ÄúThere was an unprecedented flow of finance and good will,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúWe did campaigns once Ebola was over and strengthened routine immunization. We not only recovered coverage levels, but exceeded them.‚Äù But that epidemic was largely confined to three countries with a combined population of fewer than 25 million people. This time, the entire world is affected.","['Leslie Roberts', 'Leslie Roberts Is A Science Writer In Washington']",2020-04-10 00:00:00

This initiative is a collaboration between the administration and Partners In Health, and is the first of its kind in the nation. The initiative will focus on tracing the contacts of confirmed positive COVID-19 patients, and supporting individuals in quarantine, and builds on the efforts already underway from the Command Center to leverage public health college students to augment the contact tracing being done by local boards of health.
Led by the administration‚Äôs COVID-19 Response Command Center, Partners In Health will coordinate closely with the Massachusetts Department of Public Health and the Executive Office of Health and Human Services. Contact tracing will be combined with the state‚Äôs efforts to increase testing and will provide support to people in quarantine in order to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus.
‚ÄúEnhanced contact tracing capability is another powerful tool for public health officials and health care providers in the battle against COVID-19,‚Äù said Governor Charlie Baker. ‚ÄúMassachusetts is the only state in the nation implementing this type of programming, and this collaborative tracing initiative will break new ground as we work together to slow the spread of COVID-19.‚Äù
Partners In Health will provide staff and contribute technical expertise in community tracing. The Commonwealth Health Insurance Connector Authority (CCA) will stand up a virtual support center and maintain connectivity, while the Massachusetts Department of Health (DPH) will maintain data, guides and processes. Accenture, a leading global professional services company, and Salesforce, a global leader in CRM, are implementing support center capabilities for the CTC‚Äôs tracing purposes.
‚ÄúThis is a key effort in the Commonwealth‚Äôs work to slow the spread of the virus by adding capacity to reach individuals who have come in close contact with individuals are confirmed positive for COVID-19,‚Äù said Health and Human Services Secretary Marylou Sudders. ‚ÄúI encourage residents to cooperate with the operation so that we can further slow the spread of COVID-19 in Massachusetts.‚Äù

These devices are used for patients suffering from acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) caused by COVID-19, the disease caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus. The helmet surrounds the patient‚Äôs entire head to supply oxygen and is sealed with a soft, airtight collar that wraps around the neck.
In 2016, researchers from the University of Chicago Medicine led a study showing that using these helmets instead of standard face masks that cover the nose and mouth helps critically ill patients breathe better and can prevent them from needing intubation with a ventilator machine. Patients with helmet ventilation also spent less time in the intensive care unit and had better survival.
On March 31, 2020, UChicago Medicine pulmonologists John Kress, MD, and Bhakti Patel, MD, were featured in an NBC News story about the helmet-based ventilators and the small company that produces them. View the news video below or read the NBC News article.
In a second study published in 2018, the researchers followed up with the same patients after one year. The patients who received helmet ventilation were more likely to be functionally independent than those given a face mask, and spent more days living at home.
The initial study, published in JAMA, followed 83 patients with ARDS, a severe and often lethal injury to the lungs. ARDS causes fluid to accumulate in the lungs' microscopic air sacs. It can lead to partial collapse of the lungs, dangerously low blood-oxygen levels and death.
The subjects in this study all required mechanical breathing assistance. They were randomly assigned to receive some form of noninvasive ventilation, using either a standard mask or the helmet. A primary goal of noninvasive ventilation is to prevent intubation, placement of a tube through the mouth or nose into the trachea to pump air into the lungs. Complications of endotracheal intubation are common. They include pneumonia, the need for strong sedatives, and delirium.
""In this group of critically ill patients, the helmet made a substantial difference,"" said pulmonologist John P. Kress, MD, professor of medicine at the University of Chicago and senior author of the study. ""The University's data and safety monitoring board recommended that we stop the trial early because the helmet consistently demonstrated multiple advantages, particularly the reduced need to intubate patients and longer-term reduction in mortality.""
""After reviewing our data,"" he added, ""the board felt that it would be difficult to justify enrolling more patients in the face mask arm of the trial, which exposed them to greater risks.""
The helmet ""confers several advantages over the face mask,"" the authors wrote. It is less likely to leak. This enables the care team to increase air pressure into the helmet, which helps keep the airway and lungs open and improves oxygen levels. It is also more comfortable, easier to tolerate because it doesn't touch the face, and patients can see through it well enough to watch television, talk or read.

Video Transcript
Attach the ventilator's inspiratory and expiratory tubing to the port sites on the helmet. Set the ventilator to Pressure Support Mode. To improve patient ventilator synchrony, adjust the rise time to 50 milliseconds, and change the end flow to 50%. Stretch the rubber collar of the helmet and place over the patient's head.
Once the helmet is fully inflated, attach felt arms drops to the front and back of the helmet. This secures the helmet's position on the patient's head. The helmet pressurizes in seconds. PEEP is increased to achieve adequate lung recruitment and oxygen saturation.
Notice that at this level of PEEP there's no detectable leak in the ventilator circuit. FIO2 is also titrated to a non-toxic level to achieve oxygen saturations above 90%. Prior to application of the helmet, the patient was tachypneic and required 100% FIO2 to saturate at 93%. After transition to helmet non-invasive ventilation, the patient's vital signs have substantially improved. The patient is now saturating at 99% on pressure support of 5 with a PEEP of 15 and an FIO2 of 60%. Measure the neck size of the patient. Using the collar size guide, determine where to cut the rubber collar to ensure a tight yet comfortable seal at the neck. Attach the rubber collar to the plastic inner ring of the helmet. Now attach the inner ring to the helmet's transparent hood and ensure a tight seal.Attach the ventilator's inspiratory and expiratory tubing to the port sites on the helmet. Set the ventilator to Pressure Support Mode. To improve patient ventilator synchrony, adjust the rise time to 50 milliseconds, and change the end flow to 50%.

The patient is now saturating at 99% on pressure support of 5 with a PEEP of 15 and an FIO2 of 60%.
Patients who required the face mask for oxygenation for at least 8 hours were eligible to enroll in the study. Forty-four of the 83 patients who qualified to participate were then randomly assigned to the helmet group.
The other 39 were assigned to the face mask group.
All patients were severely ill with a 50 percent risk of requiring intubation or dying in the intensive care unit. About half of the patients had weakened immune systems from cancer or transplantation.
Patients in the helmet group, however, were three times less likely to require intubation, the study's primary endpoint. Only 18.2 percent of those wearing a helmet required an endotracheal tube, versus 61.5 percent of those wearing a face mask. The helmet group had, on average, more ventilator-free days (28 vs. 12.5).
Helmet patients also were more likely to survive. When compared at 90 days, 34 percent (15 patients) in the helmet group had died, compared to 56 percent (22 patients) in the face mask group.
Adverse trial-related events were minor. They included three skin ulcers for each group.
""These findings build on a shifting paradigm where less is more in the care of critically ill patients,"" said Bhakti Patel, MD, assistant professor of medicine and first author of the study. ""We have chosen less sedation for more mental animation; less bed rest for more physical activity; and now we're choosing less intubations for more noninvasive ventilation.""

However, limited data was available for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) reactivation. This study aimed to evaluate the clinical characteristics of the SARS-CoV-2 reactivation. Methods Clinical records, laboratory results, and chest CT scans were retrospectively reviewed for 55 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia (i.e., with throat swab samples that were positive for SARS-CoV-2) who were admitted to Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China, from Jan. 8 to Feb. 10, 2020. Results All 55 patients had a history of epidemiological exposure to COVID-19, and 5 (9%) patients who discharged from hospital presented with SARS-CoV-2 reactivation. Among the 5 reactivated patients, other symptoms were also observed, including fever, cough, sore throat, and fatigue. One of the 5 patients had progressive lymphopenia (from 1.3 to 0.56 √ó 109 cells per L) and progressive neutrophilia (from 4.5 to 18.28 √ó 109 cells per L). All 5 reactivated patients presented normal aminotransferase levels. Throat swab samples from the 5 reactivated patients were tested for SARS-CoV-2, indicating all positive for the virus. Conclusions Findings from this small group of cases suggested that there was currently evidence for reactivation of SARS-CoV-2 and there might be no specific clinical characteristics to distinguish them. Keywords: SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19, Laboratory medicine, CT scan
Introduction A novel human coronavirus which is a new strain of RNA viruses was recognized in Wuhan, China, in Dec. 2019. The novel coronavirus is now officially named SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2) by International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV). The pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2 has been recently identified as COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019). COVID-19 spread quickly across Hubei Province and other regions of China,1 , 2 also the global alert for COVID-19 has been issued by the World Health Organization (WHO).1 , 2 COVID-19 could induce symptoms including fever, dry cough, dyspnea, fatigue and lymphopenia in patients, and might result in severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and even death in severe cases.1, 2, 3 SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the beta-coronavirus 2b lineage in the phylogenetic tree and shares ‚àº80% identity sequencing with the Bat SARS-like coronavirus and the original SARS epidemic virus.4 , 5 Currently, it remains to be determined the origins and possible intermediate animal vectors of SARS-CoV-2, as well as the mechanism that this virus spread among humans. Despite many reports have characterized the clinical, epidemiological, laboratory, and radiological features, as well as treatment and clinical outcomes of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, the information of the SARS-CoV-2 reactivation remains not reported. The curative and eradicative therapy for COVID-19 is not currently available. Urgent questions that need to be addressed promptly include whether patients with COVID-19 pneumonia will reactivate, and whether risk factors predict SARS-CoV-2 reactivation in patients. To prevent and control COVID-19 reactivation, we retrospectively collected and analyzed detailed clinical data from SARS-CoV-2 reactivated patients. In the study, we presented clinical features of SARS-CoV-2 reactivated patients and discussed the potential risk factors of SARS-CoV-2 reactivation.
Material and methods Study design and patients We retrospectively recruited 55 patients who were diagnosed as COVID-19 pneumonia at the Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University from Jan. 8, 2020 to Feb. 10, 2020. The patients comprised 19 males and 36 females with a median age of 37 (range 22‚Äì67 years). Diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia was based on the New Coronavirus Pneumonia Prevention and Control Program. All patients with COVID-19 pneumonia were tested positively for SARS-CoV-2 by use of quantitative RT-PCR on samples from the respiratory tract. This study was reviewed and approved by the Ethical Committee of Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University. Written informed consent was waived by the Ethics Commission for emerging infectious diseases. Data collection We reviewed clinical records, laboratory findings, and chest CT scans for all patients. Two study investigators independently reviewed the data. Throat swab samples were collected and tested for SARS-CoV-2, following WHO guidelines for qRT-PCR.6 , 7 Statistical analysis Statistical analysis was done with SPSS, version 22.0. Continuous variables were directly expressed as a range. Categorical variables were expressed as number (%).
Results At presentation, all 55 patients had a history of epidemiological exposure to COVID-19, and 5 (9%) patients who discharged from hospital presented SARS-CoV-2 reactivation. The age range of the SARS-CoV-2 reactivated patients was 27‚Äì42 years. None of the reactivated patients had underlying diseases such as diabetes, chronic hypertension, or cardiovascular disease. One patient, however, had history of tuberculosis in the mediastinal lymph node in 2009. Additionally, all the reactivated patients excluded influenza virus and H7 avian influenza virus infection upon admission to hospital. Four of the 5 patients presented with a fever without chills, one had a high fever (39.3 ¬∞C). Patients‚Äô body temperatures fluctuated within a range from 36.2 to 39.3 ¬∞C. One patient showed normal body temperature. Other symptoms of an upper respiratory tract infection were also observed: one patient had cough, one had sore throat, all patients reported fatigue ( ). Additionally, one patient showed constipation. However, none of the 5 patients developed severe pneumonia, requiring mechanical ventilation, or died of COVID-19 pneumonia, as of Feb. 24, 2020.

Discussion We confirmed that in a significantly proportion of COVID-19 patients, SARS-CoV-2 reactivation developed after discharging from hospital (9%). We reported clinical data from 5 patients with SARS-CoV-2 reactivation. The clinical characteristics of these patients with SARS-CoV-2 reactivation were similar to those of non-reactivated patients with COVID-19 infection. None of the 5 patients developed severe pneumonia or died, as of Feb. 24, 2020. Notably, based on our findings in these 5 patients, there is currently evidence to suggest that a proportion of recovered COVID-19 patients could reactivate. The reactivated patients included 1 asymptomatic patient and 4 symptomatic patients, which suggests the reactivation potential of asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic patients. The time from SARS-CoV-2 negative to positive ranged from 4 to 17 days, suggesting that recovered patients still may be virus carriers and require additional round of viral detection and isolation. We need better data to determine risk factors and mechanisms that cause SARS-CoV-2 reactivation. The timing of onset of SARS-CoV-2 reactivation can be variable depending upon the host factors, underlying disease and the type of immunosuppressive therapies. In our study, the recovered patients had positive RT-PCR test results 4‚Äì17 days later. The key risk factors for reactivation would include 3 categories: (1) host status, (2) virologic factors and (3) type and degree of immunosuppression. Host factors may include sex, older age, type of disease needing immunosuppression. Although we could not identify risk factors for these host factors in the current study, the potential requires further large cohort confirmation. The virologic factors associated with increased risk of reactivation include high baseline SARS-CoV-2 load and variable genotype. SARS-CoV-2 viral load would also linked to treatment response, disease severity and progression.8 The association of SARS-CoV-2 genotypes and viral load with SARS-CoV-2 reactivation will be an important question to address. In our study, all the patients received antiviral therapy (Oseltamivir or Arbidol). These cases suggest that SARS-CoV-2 reactivation may occur whatever the antiviral therapy used. These host and virologic factors are important considerations that may further increase the likelihood of SARS-CoV-2 reactivation. Therefore, the assessment of host as well as virologic risk factors should be important caveats to help decide whether to initiate prophylactic therapy and immunosuppression. Immunosuppressive therapies are the commonly used causative agents. These agents have a general mechanism that inhibits many immune functions. For example, steroid inhibits cell-mediated immunity by suppressing interleukins production which is important for T and B cell proliferation.9 It is thus not surprising that these general immunosuppressive effects result in broad immune dysfunctions and potential SARS-CoV-2 reactivation. SARS-CoV-2 reactivation will be a vexing and persistent problem. Considering numerous patients infected or previously exposed to the virus, such a problem poses a major public health burden in terms of global morbidity and possibly mortality. Currently, we did not find reliable markers in predicting the risk of SARS-CoV-2 reactivation, nor there are any validated tests to determine whether a particular drug or therapy is associated with SARS-CoV-2 reactivation. The latter point was often determined by our empirical experience. Although decades of the experiences helped us to identify important drugs and to manage these situations appropriately, we could not accurately evaluate the risk of the drugs prior to its clinical application. Considering the significance of this ongoing global public health emergency, although our conclusions are limited by the small sample size, we believe that the findings are important to understand the clinical characteristics and SARS-CoV-2 reactivation potential in COVID-19 patients.

Technical report
This document provides the ECDC opinion on the suitability of face masks and other face covers in the community by individuals who are not ill in order to reduce potential pre-symptomatic or asymptomatic transmission of COVID-19 from the mask wearer to others.
Executive summary
The use of medical face masks by healthcare workers must be given priority over the use in the community.
The use of face masks in public may serve as a means of source control to reduce the spread of the infection in the community by minimising the excretion of respiratory droplets from infected individuals who have not yet developed symptoms or who remain asymptomatic. It is not known how much the use of masks in the community can contribute to a decrease in transmission in addition to the other countermeasures.
The use of face masks in the community could be considered, especially when visiting busy, closed spaces, such as grocery stores, shopping centres, or when using public transport, etc.
The use of non-medical face masks made of various textiles could be considered, especially if ‚Äì due to supply problems ‚Äì medical face masks must be prioritised for use as personal protective equipment by healthcare workers. This is based on limited indirect evidence supporting the use of non-medical face masks as a means of source control.
The use of face masks in the community should be considered only as a complementary measure and not as a replacement for established preventive measures, for example physical distancing, respiratory etiquette, meticulous hand hygiene and avoiding touching the face, nose, eyes and mouth.
Appropriate use of face masks is key for the effectiveness of the measure and can be improved through education campaigns.
Recommendations on the use of face masks in the community should carefully take into account evidence gaps, the supply situation, and potential negative side effects.

New York, New York ‚Äì April 2, 2020 ‚Äì Widespread confusion, conflicting reports, inconsistent testing, and off-indication use of existing and experimental drugs has resulted in no single source of information from the frontlines. To create a centralized and dynamic knowledge base, Sermo, the largest healthcare data collection company and global social platform for physicians, leveraged its capabilities to publish results of a COVID-19 study with more than 6,200 physicians in 30 countries. The study was completed in three days. Data covers current treatment and prophylaxis options, timing to the outbreak peak, effectiveness of government responses, and much more. Results of the first wave can be found at sermo.com. Multiple study waves including a deeper dive into treatments will be conducted over the next several weeks, and Sermo is calling all physicians globally to participate.
Key findings; Sermo Real Time Barometer*:
Treatments & Efficacy
The three most commonly prescribed treatments amongst COVID-19 treaters are 56% analgesics, 41% Azithromycin, and 33% Hydroxychloroquine
Hydroxychloroquine usage amongst COVID-19 treaters is 72% in Spain, 49% in Italy, 41% in Brazil, 39% in Mexico, 28% in France, 23% in the U.S., 17% in Germany, 16% in Canada, 13% in the UK and 7% in Japan
Hydroxychloroquine was overall chosen as the most effective therapy amongst COVID-19 treaters from a list of 15 options (37% of COVID-19 treaters) 75% in Spain, 53% Italy, 44% in China, 43% in Brazil, 29% in France, 23% in the U.S. and 13% in the U.K.
The two most common treatment regimens for Hydroxychloroquine were: (38%) 400mg twice daily on day one; 400 mg daily for five days (26%) 400mg twice daily on day one; 200mg twice daily for four days
Outside the U.S., Hydroxychloroquine was equally used for diagnosed patients with mild to severe symptoms whereas in the U.S. it was most commonly used for high risk diagnosed patients
Globally, 19% of physicians prescribed or have seen Hydroxychloroquine prophylactically used for high risk patients, and 8% for low risk patients
Second Wave of Outbreak
The second global outbreak is anticipated by 83% of global physicians, 90% of U.S. physicians but only 50% of Chinese physicians
Average Testing Time
On average tests in the U.S. take 4-5 days, and in 10% of cases the wait is more than 7 days
14% of U.S. physicians and over 50% in all of Europe and Japan report getting test results in 24 hours; in China 73% of doctors get tests back in 24 hours, while 8% get tests back within the hour
Prioritizing Treatment if Ventilator Shortage
In all countries except China, the top criteria for deciding who should receive a ventilator first was patients with the highest chance of recovery (47%) followed by those most ill and at highest risk of death (21%), then first responders (15%) In China the priorities were reversed as the most ill and highest risk of death received ventilators
First responders were more important in the U.S.
France, Japan, and Italy prioritized age
Brazil and Russia prioritized higher risk patients
Peak Timing & Restrictions
In the U.S., 63% of physicians recommend restrictions be lifted six or more weeks from now and 66% believe the peak is at least 3-4 weeks away
Government Effectiveness
The large majority of physicians globally believe government actions are very to somewhat effective
A majority of physicians believe state and government are weighing public and economic concerns appropriately
Top Three Equipment Needs
Top three needs globally are Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), followed by rapid COVID-19 testing kits, then ventilators
Top Three Information Needs
Physicians are most in need of knowing when rapid tests will become available, when new treatments will become available, and the efficacy of existing medications to treat coronavirus
COVID-19 Concerns
A majority of physicians are very concerned about spreading it to family members and ~50% are concerned about catching COVID-19 in the next two months
81% of physicians have taken special precautions at home, including changing their clothes and showering before joining family; some even stay in isolation
Close to a quarter of physicians and over a third of patients report extreme stress

‚ÄúThis is a treasure trove of global insights for policy makers. Physicians should have more of a voice in how we deal with this pandemic and be able to quickly share information with one another and the world,‚Äù said Peter Kirk, CEO, Sermo. ‚ÄúWith censorship of the media and the medical community in some countries, along with biased and poorly designed studies, solutions to the pandemic are being delayed. We invite global physicians to contribute to help inform policy makers, their colleagues, and the public.‚Äù
‚ÄúThis survey of front line doctors shows the value of critical information sharing between countries. That is the only way that a new insight from one country can rapidly save lives around the world,‚Äù said Dr. Murali Doraiswamy, professor of psychiatry and medicine at Duke University School of Medicine and a scientific advisor to Sermo.

Deze animaties zijn grotendeels gemaakt met manim, een scrappy open-source python-bibliotheek: https://github.com/3b1b/manim
Als je het wil bekijken, voel ik me gedwongen je te waarschuwen dat het niet de meest goed gedocumenteerde tool is, en het heeft veel andere eigenaardigheden die je zou verwachten in een bibliotheek die iemand heeft geschreven met alleen eigen gebruik in gedachten.
De broncode voor deze video is zichtbaar op de onderstaande link, maar het, eh, ongemakkelijke deel is dat het is gemaakt op een tak van manim waar ik veel andere dingen aan het herwerken ben en nog niet alle knikken of voeg documentatie toe, dus ik weet niet helemaal zeker hoe gemakkelijk het voor anderen zal zijn om aan de slag te gaan. In beide gevallen zou je gemakkelijk moeten kunnen zien hoe alle simulaties werkten.

let's flatten the curve!
What is Coronavirus?
Coronavirus is a very annoying virus
that easily spreads from one person to another.
What is R 0 ?
R 0 is the basic reproduction number of an infectious disease
or in other words a number that tells how contagious an infectious disease is.
For the Coronavirus we currently think R 0 might be between 1 and 4
which means that on average one infected person spreads the virus to 1 to 4 others
who then also infect between 1 and 4 other people and so on.
R 0 depends on many things like the environment
but also on how we behave and how well we are organized.
Unfortunately it is not easy to know what R 0 is during an ongoing pandemic
but whatever the number is exactly we can do smart things to lower it.
Washing hands & keeping distance
Washing your hands and keeping distance from others
are very effective ways of helping to get R 0 down
Wear a Mask to cover your Nose and Mouth
Whenever you go outside make sure to wear a mask
to cover both your nose and mouth
Here is how to create your own masks
and help others in your community
You can also help to make others aware about wearing masks
by updating your avatar on social networks and by using the #masks4all hashtag.
The next time you see someone wearing a mask show them
how thankful you are by showing a simple hand gesture from the distance.
üññ‚úåÔ∏è This helps to accelerate social acceptance of masks in your community.
Wearing masks in public is recommended
or even mandatory in more and more regions in the world.
In other regions this is still an important grass-roots effort.

Some say the specific circumstances of their state doesn‚Äôt merit such a mandate, others have advocated social responsibility instead, and yet others have expressed a preference for following the advice of their state officials.
The governors do have one significant trait in common: They‚Äôre all Republican.

Of course, so is President Donald Trump, who has resisted calls for a national mandate that might send the strongest, most unambiguous message about the importance of social distancing to curb spread of the virus.
It‚Äôs doubtful the president can actually supersede the governors‚Äô authority in this area, but he could strengthen federal guidelines that stop short of directing citizens to remain at home except for essential activities.
In the absence of such a command, Arkansas, Iowa, Nebraska, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Utah and Wyoming continue to allow their residents relatively free movement.
Why hasn't there been a national lockdown?
¬© Eric Gay, AP A worker wearing gloves and a protective face mask cleans public areas along a mostly deserted River Walk in downtown San Antonio, Texas on April 2, 2020. San Antonio is under stay-at-home orders due to the COVID-19 outbreak. Legal experts have said Trump doesn‚Äôt have the authority to impose a national lockdown as the heads of countries such as Italy, Spain, France and Britain have done. But he does have some tools at his disposal, including the bully pulpit and the ability to restrict air travel between COVID-19 hot spots.
Trump has pointed out some states haven‚Äôt had a large number of cases. Those tend to be sparsely populated states in the middle of the country, such as Wyoming, North Dakota and South Dakota. As of Sunday, none of them had more than 215 cases, although their numbers were rising.
What do stay-at-home and shelter-in-place orders mean?
While some states call for shelter-in-place orders, others are calling their directives stay-at-home orders. The directives differ by location but generally require people to avoid all nonessential outings and stay inside as much as possible.
They allow residents to continue performing tasks essential to the health and safety of family and pets. It's still fine to buy groceries, go for a run, walk the dog, pick up medicine, visit a doctor or get supplies to work from home.
Federal guidelines give state and local authorities leeway in what they consider ""essential"" businesses during an emergency. But in general, those industries include grocery stores and food production, pharmacies, health care, utilities, shipping, banking, other governmental services, law enforcement, emergency services and news outlets.
Here's what the mandates to fight off the coronavirus look like in each state as of Sunday:
Alabama
Gov. Kay Ivey issued a stay-at-home order on April 3, which went into effect at 5 p.m. on April 4.
""I can‚Äôt say this any more clearly‚Äî#COVID19 is an imminent threat to our way of life, & you need to understand that we‚Äôre past urging people to stay home. It is NOW the law,"" Ivey said in a tweet announcing the order.
Alaska
The Last Frontier on March 27 implemented what it's calling a ‚Äúsocial distancing‚Äù mandate, which is similar to a shelter-in-place order. Gov. Mike Dunleavy directed residents to stay at home and banned most travel within the state. Visitors to Alaska also have to self-quarantine.
‚ÄúWe crossed a line today for Alaska,‚Äù Dunleavy said after the state's first death linked to the coronavirus.
Arizona
Gov. Doug Ducey‚Äôs ""Stay Home, Stay Healthy, Stay Connected"" order, announced March 30, that would extend until April 30.
Arkansas
Gov. Asa Hutchinson has directed residents not to gather in groups larger than 10 but has not forced them to stay in. ‚ÄúI do not want to go to a shelter-in-place environment,‚Äù Hutchinson said.
California
Gov. Gavin Newsom announced a statewide shelter-in-place order March 19, and identified 16 critical infrastructure sectors to remain open ‚Äì including those providing food, health care and energy.
""This is a dynamic situation,"" Newsom said. ""I don't expect this to be many, many months, but for the time being, we are recognizing the next eight weeks"" as especially important.
Colorado
Gov. Jared Polis on March 25 issued a statewide stay-at-home order that went into effect the next morning and will run until April 11. The order stipulates that Coloradans should leave their homes only for ""critical activities.""
""Now is the time to stay at home,‚Äù Polis said. ""You have the chance to be a hero and save thousands of lives by staying at home. The lives of many Coloradans hinge on your ability to be able to stay at home for the next couple weeks to the most of your ability ... Now is not the time to die.""

Connecticut
Gov. Ned Lamont announced an executive order March 20 that directed all nonessential businesses and not-for-profit entities to prohibit all in-person functions if possible. The order excludes essential business, such as health care, food service, law enforcement and similar critical services.
The order recommended that people maintain social distancing, limit outdoor recreational activities to non-contact and limit the use of public transportation, among other items.
Delaware
Gov. John Carney ordered residents of The First State to stay at home and closed nonessential businesses, on March 24.
Florida
Two days before extending the mandate to the whole state Wednesday, Gov. Ron DeSantis issued a ‚ÄúSafer at Home‚Äô‚Äô order that applied to Broward, Miami-Dade, Monroe and Palm Beach counties. Nearly 60% of the state‚Äôs cases of coronavirus have been concentrated in those four counties.
Other counties have issued their own orders, and some of the state‚Äôs beaches have closed their parking lots to discourage large gatherings. DeSantis has ordered visitors to the state from the New York metro area and Louisiana to self-quarantine for 14 days. The Florida Keys have closed to visitors.
Georgia
On April 1, Gov. Brian Kemp signed a stay-at-home order that would also keep schools closed through the end of the school year. Before that, the city of Atlanta and Cobb and Gwinnett counties had required residents to stay home.
Hawaii
Gov. David Ige signed a stay-at-home order March 23 that went into effect two days later, prohibiting gatherings of more than 10 people. The order will be effective through April 30.
Residents can leave home ""only for essential activities or to engage in the essential businesses and operations."" As long as social distancing is practiced, ""ocean activities such as surfing and swimming"" are also exempted.

Idaho
Gov. Brad Little on March 25 signed an ""Order to Self-Isolate"" that became effective immediately and will run for three weeks. The order exempts residents who need to leave for essential activities. Little also signed an ""extreme emergency declaration"" and mobilized the Idaho National Guard ""to support civil authorities and local jurisdictions.""
Illinois
Gov. J.B. Pritzker announced a ""stay-at-home"" order March 20 that began the following day and will last until at least April 7.
All nonessential businesses must close, and all people who can work from home must do so, Pritzker said. All Illinois schools will stay closed until at least April 8.
Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot said the order ""is not a lockdown or martial law."" Pharmacies, grocery stores, clinics and airports remain open and garbage is being collected.
Indiana
Gov. Eric J. Holcomb told residents on March 23 to stay at home until at least April 7, asking ""Hoosiers to hunker down"" in an executive order.
The order gives Indiana State Police and local law enforcement the authority to enforce the order.
Iowa
Gov. Kim Reynolds has not mandated that Iowans stay home, saying an informal guidance that they do so is ‚Äúequivalent‚Äô‚Äô to an order, although it does not have law-enforcement power.
Kansas
After citing models that predicted a possible increase of local cases in Kansas to 900 over the following week, Gov. Laura Kelly signed an executive ""stay home"" order March 28. The order became effective March 30 and will run until April 19. It allows Kansans to leave their homes for essential activities.
‚ÄúI know this is hard, and I can‚Äôt tell you how much I wish it weren‚Äôt necessary,‚Äù Kelly said. ‚ÄúBut we have a small window to ensure that Kansas does not suffer the same terrible fate of other hard-hit states like New York and Missouri.""
Kentucky
Gov. Andy Beshear on March 25 signed an order encouraging residents to remain ""Healthy at Home,'' which he later said amounts to a directive to remain in the house except for essential activities. While many medical facilities have complied with a request to cease elective procedures, it became a mandate starting Monday.
He further tightened restrictions, and on March 30 signed an executive order telling Kentuckians they cannot travel outside the state with a few exceptions. If they do, they'll need to self-quarantine for 14 days.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre asking everyone to use their common sense, think about the impact this virus is having on the sick and elderly, and to limit their interactions with other people,'' Baker said.
Michigan
Gov. Gretchen Whitmer on March 23 signed a ""Stay Home, Stay Safe'' executive order that runs through April 13. Violating the order is a criminal misdemeanor and could bring fines and also result in businesses being shut down.
""I know this will be hard, but it will be temporary,"" Whitmer said. ""If we all come together, get serious, and do our part by staying home, we can stay safe and save lives.‚Äù
Minnesota
Gov. Tim Walz signed an executive order March 25 that directs residents to stay in their homes and limit movement to essential activities.

Mississippi
Gov. Tate Reeves had encouraged residents to stay home but did not mandate it until April 1, when he said at a news conference: ""We know that there are some who still do not have a healthy fear of this virus. They are wrong, and they are risking lives if they do not take this very, very seriously.‚Äù
The day before, Reeves had issued such an order for Lauderdale County only.
Missouri
, Gov. Mike Parson issued a statewide ‚ÄúStay Home Missouri‚Äù order to run through April 24.

Nebraska
Gov. Pete Ricketts on April 3 issued an updated directed health measure for the entire state. The order closes restaurant and bars' dining rooms, cancels classes at schools and imposes an 10-person limit on public gathering, among other provisions.

Nevada
On April 1, Gov. Steve Sisolak changed his stay-at-home guidance to a directive, at the same time extending closures of schools and nonessential businesses to April 30.

Texas
Gov. Greg Abbott had left decisions on stay-at-home restrictions to local governments rather than issuing a statewide edict, but on March 31 he signed an executive order that said residents should avoid leaving home for the next month except for essential activities.

A senior WHO official told reporters there was some possibility of airborne transmission of the virus that has now infected over 1 million people and killed 50,000 people worldwide since emerging in China last December.
But the main driver of the pandemic was still believed to be sick people with symptoms who were coughing and sneezing and contaminating surfaces or other people.
‚ÄúWe must preserve medical surgical respirator masks for our frontline workers. But the idea of using respiratory coverings or mouth coverings to prevent coughing or sneezing projecting disease into the environment and towards others ... that in itself is not a bad idea,‚Äù Dr. Mike Ryan, the WHO‚Äôs top emergencies expert, told a news conference.
Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease who is top U.S. infectious disease official, said on Friday that Americans should cover their face if they have to go in public, but they should still stay isolated as much as possible.
Ryan acknowledged a ‚Äúvery important and healthy debate‚Äù on the wearing of masks.
He said that if used, they should be part of a comprehensive strategy and would not negate the need for handwashing and social distancing.
‚ÄúSo we can certainly see circumstances in which the use of masks, both homemade or cloth masks, at community level may help in an overall comprehensive response to this disease,‚Äù he said.
Ryan, citing data from Italy, said that there did not appear to be a link between people taking drugs against hypertension known as ace inhibitors and getting the disease or developing severe disease.

Exhausted staff in some overwhelmed health care systems could be a factor in mortality rates, Ryan said, adding: ‚ÄúWe need to reduce the tsunamis of patients coming through the door to give doctors, nurses and other carers the opportunity to save more lives.‚Äù
Dr. Maria van Kerkhove, a WHO epidemiologist, cautioned against comparing mortality rates between countries, noting that some may be missing mild infections as they focus on patients in severe condition.
‚ÄúWhat we really need to be focusing on right now is what is the age profile of people who are in ICU (intensive care units),‚Äù she said.
‚ÄúWe are seeing more and more individuals who are of the younger age group - in their 30s, in their 40s, in their 50s - who are in ICU and who are dying,‚Äù she said, citing Italy and China.
Generally older people or those with underlying medical conditions will have more advanced disease and a higher risk of death, van Kerkhove said.
‚ÄúBut we have some time to go before we can really understand what mortality looks like across different countries so I would urge you to take those mortality rates with caution when comparing across countries,‚Äù she said.","['Stephanie Nebehay', 'Min Read']",2020-04-03 19:46:38
107,c7800aca-bfa3-46e3-ab4d-bef6209d16b7,sagecbowen,https://medium.com/@tomaspueyo/coronavirus-out-of-many-one-36b886af37e9,"Coronavirus: Out of Many, One","China is the only good example to understand how the markets value a massive outbreak, because it‚Äôs the only country that has had a huge one and that has (apparently) been able to control it.
When Hubei shut down, the markets panicked. But as soon as they were down, they started going back up again. By the beginning of March, they had gone back to nearly normal, their level before the lockdown, and a similar level as the year before. What that means is that investors believed a full shutdown of an area of 60 million people barely registered in the grand scheme of things.
Only when the coronavirus became a pandemic did investors start worrying again. But what matters here is how they valued the cost of the lockdown. The answer appears to be: Not much.
Incidentally, the day President Trump announced the National Emergency, markets went up.
This is not much information, but we need to realize that we‚Äôre making decisions that might cost millions of lives with very little data. Any information we have needs to be part of our analysis. And so far, all the evidence we have suggests a suppression strategy would not be more expensive than mitigation, but rather the opposite.
Ok, let‚Äôs take a step back. Now we have some evidence that:
21st century pandemics have tended to have a short-term effect on the economy
Quicker and longer social distancing measures probably benefit the economy
A lockdown that can control an outbreak was enough to increase the confidence of investors to bring the Chinese stock market back to the levels before the lockdown.
Based on the little we know today, it looks like Suppression is economically better than Mitigation once you have an outbreak.
The Price of a Life
One of the core challenges lawmakers have when comparing Suppression and Mitigation is that tradeoffs between life and money are hard. The major benefit of Suppression, the lives saved, can‚Äôt be translated into money.
But it can.
The cost in deaths to the US would range between $750 billion and $15 trillion.
We do that all the time. In insurance, pharmacology or healthcare, for example, society has to decide how much a life is worth.
This is a painful reality in healthcare: We don‚Äôt have infinite resources. We can‚Äôt, unfortunately, treat everybody for everything. Otherwise, we would go bankrupt. As a society, we are forced to make decisions: How should we spend the limited resources we have? What measures are worth paying for, and which ones are too expensive?
The way we calculate this is by asking ourselves: How much are we willing to pay to extend our life? In healthcare in the US, that number turns out to be between $50,000 and $150,000 per year.
If we assume the average age of death for coronavirus is 78, these people have on average 10 more years to live, which means the average coronavirus patient would pay up to $1.5 million to avoid death (10 years * $150,000 per year).
We don‚Äôt live to make money. We make money to live.
In my previous post, I explained how direct deaths from a mitigation strategy in the US could range between 500,000 and over 10 million. As a quick back-of-the-envelope reminder, it‚Äôs the result of assuming the share of the US population that gets infected ranges between 40% and 75%, and the fatality rate ranges between 1% (currently 1.5% in South Korea, the country with some of the best testing and healthcare system) and 4% (Hubei region. Note the current fatality rate in Italy is ~10%, but they are probably undercounting cases). That does not account for collateral damage (other people who die because they don‚Äôt have access to urgent healthcare), which could greatly increase the death rate.
If we account for how much we value life, the cost of the coronavirus in deaths for the US would be between $750 billion and $15 trillion. For context, that‚Äôs between 4% and 75% of GDP. The cost in lives would be staggering.
Let‚Äôs summarize all this information
Notes: some people have asked me how it is possible that the value of some people‚Äôs lives is comparable to the size of GDP. GDP is broadly the value created in a year, not the total wealth we have. The total wealth we have in the US is approximately $1 million per person on average, which means the US‚Äôs wealth is ~$320 trillion. That does not account for the wealth in terms of life, but puts the cost of $15 trillion in lives into perspective. Also I haven‚Äôt talked about the costs to the economy of the Dance phase of the Suppression strategy, once heavy social distancing measures subside. That‚Äôs because, if done well, countries can ‚Äúdance‚Äù with only a small subset of measures that don‚Äôt cost much: testing, contact tracing, quarantines, isolation, hygiene education, and travel bans. Note finally that a suppression strategy would cost all of society but would benefit older people more, as they are the ones most likely to be saved by these measures. As such, they are a transfer of wealth from all of society towards our seniors, who in the US tend to vote Republican.
Some societies are adopting a ‚Äúsurvival of the fittest‚Äù approach, exposing their populations to the virus and letting the weak die. But it looks like that approach might weaken these societies more, making them, in turn, not be the fittest they could be in the face of this epidemic.
All these numbers, with the surprising conclusion that a Suppression strategy would likely be less costly than a Mitigation strategy. But these numbers obscure a larger truth:
We don‚Äôt live to make money. We make money to live.
And the best way to illustrate that is through war.
4. Out of Many, One
This is War
President Trump put it very clearly on March 18th: This is war.
He compared the sacrifices we will need to make to those of World War II. This is exactly how we should be looking at the problem.
Imagine we had foreign agents. They have infiltrated the US. They are invisible. They are spreading across the country: slowly, silently. And then, they strike: rapidly, randomly. People start falling left and right. Over a matter of days, the death toll of 9/11 is passed, and then dwarfed. At some point, it becomes clear that the death toll will be worse than Iraq. Worse than Vietnam. Worse than World War II. Worse than all of America‚Äôs wars combined.
If this was happening, the US would stop everything it‚Äôs doing and single-mindedly focus all of its attention and money to beat this enemy.
That‚Äôs why the US has the mightiest military in the world. That‚Äôs why it spent $2.4 trillion on the wars against Iraq and Afghanistan. That‚Äôs why, during World War II, two-thirds of the American economy had been integrated into the war effort: to beat the enemies that threaten America.
This is what should be happening now. The fact that our enemies are invisible viruses and not invisible agents doesn‚Äôt change much. If anything, it only makes it easier, because we‚Äôre smarter than them and we can beat them.
But only one entity can declare war and harness the resources we would need: the federal government.
Survival of the Fittest
China had a centralized response to the coronavirus. South Korea had a centralized response. Taiwan. Italy. Spain. France. UK. Poland. India. All centralized responses. Meanwhile, so far in the US, we have let states take the lead.
There are many situations where that approach is reasonable. But waging war against an exponentially growing threat that all countries face at the same time is not one of those situations.
We have a $2 trillion package to fight the coronavirus. It‚Äôs a war-like budget, but without war-like measures. The government has invoked the Defense Production Act, for example, but hasn‚Äôt actually used it yet. As a result, states and companies are struggling to face the challenge, but in some places, they‚Äôre drowning.
Trade War over Supplies
One of the best examples is the purchase of personal protective equipment (PPE), such as masks, goggles, gowns or gloves.
Traditional medical distributors such as Cardinal Health or McKesson are doing what they can to get PPEs from the manufacturing center of the world, China. Except that China has been closed for business for nearly a month. Just as the supply plummeted, demand exploded around the world, with orders of magnitude more requests from all countries in the world for more of everything. Even if China wanted, it couldn‚Äôt supply everything. That‚Äôs assuming that China wants to. In the middle of a trade war with the US, and with a grey market that is much more profitable than the official one, the traditional channels don‚Äôt work. Suppliers are selling to the highest bidder.
When there‚Äôs will, we can overcome these challenges, such as the recent airlifting of medical supplies spearheaded by the White House. But this is piecemeal right now, not a systematic approach.
Homegrown Mess for Protective Equipment
The country is mobilized. Everybody wants to help, from tech to education. In healthcare, hundreds of initiatives have sprung up to produce the PPEs our healthcare workers need. Manufacturing plants across the country are trying to change their production towards masks, face screens or any other PPE. But they don‚Äôt have the money, designs or logistics to start, and they don‚Äôt know where to sell. Dozens of organizations have sprung up to help, such as the PPE Coalition. But we need one master effort to immediately coordinate all manufacturers, financiers, designers, lawyers, logistics experts, and customers in one place.
If we had months, the private sector could figure it out. But we have days. When you need speed, you need a single actor coordinating everything, and the obvious one is the federal government.
But the response so far has been for states to figure it out by themselves. The federal government has told state governors to find ventilators by themselves. That is tragic.
Fratricide for Ventilators
First, states are not experts on this. They don‚Äôt have their own CDCs. They don‚Äôt deal with ventilator markets. They don‚Äôt know where the supply is. Every day counts, but instead of mandating what needs to happen, thousands of state employees are trying to become overnight experts in ventilator and PPE procurement.
But even if they were experts, they couldn‚Äôt do it. Because now every state is fighting for itself. Every state needs ventilators, either because they need them today, or because they will need them tomorrow. This is a matter of life and death, so they‚Äôre bidding against each other. Ventilator and PPE providers are looking at this and selling to the highest bidder. Survival of the fittest.
States are bidding against each other for ventilators and protective equipment. Survival of the fittest.
A coordinated federal response would eliminate all these problems: it would harness the experience of the best experts, it would determine the prices and quantities to be manufactured, and it would distribute assets based on needs, not on whoever is fast and rich enough to buy them first.
Unaffordable Testing Kits
Arguably, the single most important measure against the coronavirus is to test as many people as possible to identify all the infected, isolate them, trace their contacts, and quarantine them. This is the bread and butter of how all East Asia countries have controlled the virus. It‚Äôs how we‚Äôll know how when, in a Suppression strategy, it‚Äôs time to switch from the Hammer (total lockdown) to the Dance (relaxed social distancing measures).
But in the US, not only do we have a very hard time testing. It‚Äôs unaffordable. If testing for the virus was as simple as getting a test covered by your insurance, that would be easy. But that‚Äôs not how it works.
People who are symptomatic and seek care may be billed for a visit with a doctor, an influenza test, a chest x-ray, and bacterial, viral, or blood culture tests. These costs can add up very quickly, particularly for people with no insurance or who have high-deductible health plans. ‚Äî Castlight Report
With all these, a simple coronavirus test can end up costing people over $4,000. That does not include the treatment. There is no way you can test everybody with that price tag.
Contact Tracing and Quarantine Enforcement
China had 1,800 teams of five people each figuring out every single person that a coronavirus patient might have infected while out and about. These techniques were extremely advanced, looking at mobile phone location or credit card data, cross-referencing with mass transport tickets, and using other tools to identify every single potential contagion.
Meanwhile, in the US, we‚Äôre leaving all of that to the states.
Quarantine enforcement is equally technologically-advanced and time-consuming. Some countries use apps, while others track the movement of your phone to know if you‚Äôre still at home and call you if they suspect you left your phone home.
None of this exists in the US. As we know, the NSA already has a lot of this data. The government is already using it, they‚Äôre just not using it for this yet, and 50 states can‚Äôt be expected to all figure it out on their own.
The government doesn‚Äôt need to do all of this, but it needs to coordinate it. We will go much faster if we develop a single app for all states and we tell everybody to use that same app. We will also need software for contact tracing workers to do their job. States can employ these workers, but with the time we have available, the fastest way to get this done is through a the federal government, even if it‚Äôs through a public-private partnership between with tech companies.
All of that can be done while maintaining privacy, like in Singapore. And if people don‚Äôt want to use the app, they can opt out like in Poland and just expect random visits from state enforcement workers.
The Weakest Link
All of this puts US states in a very tough situation. The richest ones might be able to organize all of this and develop the technology required. But many will not. These states will suffer outbreaks they can‚Äôt see or control. That will create difficult dynamics between them.
Imagine Alaska applies a costly Hammer and locks down the state for weeks. It manages to control the epidemic, and sets up great testing and contact tracing processes. Meanwhile, maybe Texas doesn‚Äôt want to do the same, and there‚Äôs an uncontrolled epidemic.
What will Alaska do? Will it let Texans come, at risk of seeding new outbreaks? No, it will want to ban them from traveling to Alaska. Clever Texans will just travel to another state and go from there to Alaska. So Alaska will be forced to seal its borders. And every state that takes the coronavirus seriously will have to seal its borders too. This is already happening.
If you think that‚Äôs impossible, legal experts disagree: states can close their borders to other states.
When the federal government treats every state like an independent country, the states require the same tools as those of independent countries. Even though Spain is part of the European Union, as an independent country, it sealed its borders.
Individual states are only as strong as the weakest link. Either the US mandates measures at the federal level, or states will be forced to behave like countries and eventually seal their borders.
What Should the States and the Federal Government Do?
The takeaway is that both states and the federal government have their own roles to fulfill. So far, states are taking the lead, and many are doing what‚Äôs needed. But some haven‚Äôt. And even the best ones still need coordination in some areas.
Based on all of this, here are some key measures the federal government should contemplate:
Healthcare Supplies: Centralize the purchase of critical supplies (ventilators, PPEs, test kits‚Ä¶) and allocate them to states, allowing them to distribute within the state. Provide supplier guarantees so that they don‚Äôt underproduce in fear of ending up with too much unsold inventory.
Homegrown Production: Support the homegrown production of critical supplies, including financing and supplier guarantees. Determine a clearinghouse so that supply, demand, and philanthropic help know where to meet. Either build one through a public-private partnership, or anoint one of the existing platforms to speed up market making (eg, Google for ventilators, PPE Coalition for PPEs).
Centralize Contact Tracing: Build with a public/private partnership the technology needed to trace contacts easily. Create a law that requires companies to hand over the data needed to make it work and allows its use by federal and state employees. Provides the tools for states to actually carry out the contact tracing. Create the tools in a way that privacy is optimized, and add an automatic expiration date to the law.
Either mandate country-wide social distancing measures, or provide very specific guidelines for states and clarify their ability to seal borders with each other. The application of social distancing measures should adapt to the reality on the ground: What works in infected cities with lots of work-from-home ability might not fit rural areas with low density, no coronavirus cases, and predominant farming activity. If a federal mandate is unworkable, use access to other resources and funding for compliance.
Speed up decision-making or get out of the way when states need agility. For example, testing kits could arguably be better off without the heavy oversight of the FDA, given all the international best practices and the speed of local laboratories. Use the FDA recommendations as guidance and best practices, rather than as a gate.
Lead an initiative to guarantee free coronavirus testing to citizens, all costs included.
Actively update travel bans: Right now, they are mostly from China, Iran and Europe, but that doesn‚Äôt reflect the reality on the ground anymore. There are as of today 23 countries outside of these places with more than 1,000 cases, and many more quickly growing.
Support states with advice and money to educate the population on the importance and best practices of social distancing and hygiene.
Conclusion: Join, or Die
The United States is the strongest country in the world. It has the most vibrant economy, the mightiest military. It has inspired democracies through history, and shines the values of freedom around the world.
All of this originated two and a half centuries ago, when a group of ragtag colonies, subservient to a remote king, decided to band together to overturn a tyranny.
That triumph emerged from the union of the original thirteen states. Independent, they couldn‚Äôt beat the mighty United Kingdom. Together, they did.
This is why the US is called the United States. It was the union that brought the force. It‚Äôs why the seal of the United States of America declares: E Pluribus Unum.
Out of many, one.
We are facing the biggest battle of our generation, and it all comes down to today. We have two options on our hands: Either we unite as a country, or we will crumble as individual states.
The margin of error is so small. A few days off, and thousands more die. Our healthcare workers are already dying on the lines. They‚Äôre willing to give their lives for all of us. Because that‚Äôs what living is about. We, too, need to fight for every life of our compatriots. Because we know, when we add up these lives, this will make the difference between winning and losing. Between living, or letting our loved ones die.
I want to be on the winning team. Do you?",['Tomas Pueyo'],2020-04-01 22:49:50

Joshua Lott for The New York Times
It has been about two weeks since the Illinois governor ordered residents to stay at home, but nothing has changed about Adarra Benjamin‚Äôs responsibilities. She gets on a bus nearly every morning in Chicago, traveling 20 miles round trip some days to cook, clean and shop for her clients, who are older or have health problems that make such tasks difficult.
Ms. Benjamin knows the dangers, but she needs her job, which pays about $13 an hour. She also cannot imagine leaving her clients to fend for themselves. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôve become my family,‚Äù she said.
In cities across America, many lower-income workers continue to move around, while those who make more money are staying home and limiting their exposure to the coronavirus, according to smartphone location data analyzed by The New York Times.
Although people in all income groups are moving less than they did before the crisis, wealthier people are staying home the most, especially during the workweek. Not only that, but in nearly every state, they began doing so days before the poor, giving them a head start on social distancing as the virus spread, according to aggregated data from the location analysis company Cuebiq, which tracks about 15 million cellphone users nationwide daily.
Beginning in early March, people across the country started limiting their movements as the coronavirus spread. Similar trends can be seen from coast to coast, including in the 25 most populous metropolitan areas. The wealthiest people, those in the top 10 percent of income, however, have limited their movement more than those in the bottom 10 percent of the same metro areas, according to a Times analysis of cellphone location data. By March 16, when President Trump asked people to stay at home to slow the spread of the virus, those in the wealthiest and poorest areas were both moving less than usual. But by that date, those in the highest-income locations had already cut their movement by nearly half. Poorer areas did not see a similar drop until three days later.
The data offers real-time evidence of a divide laid bare by the coronavirus pandemic ‚Äî one in which wealthier people not only have more job security and benefits but also may be better able to avoid becoming sick. The outbreak is so new that the relationship between socioeconomic status and infection rates cannot be determined, but other data, including recent statistics released by public health officials in New York City, suggests that the coronavirus is hitting low-income neighborhoods the hardest.
Concerns about getting infected have incited protests and strikes by workers in grocery stores, delivery services and other industries who say their employers are not providing them with enough protection or compensation to counter the increased health risks, even as their jobs have been deemed essential.
Rules vary among states, but essential workers generally include those in health care and public safety roles, as well as caregivers, delivery drivers, grocery clerks and plumbers. Hardware stores, pharmacies and takeout restaurants also remain open and staffed. All of these workers are able to stay on the job ‚Äî a boon in an economy seized by shutdowns ‚Äî but in most cases they cannot claim unemployment benefits if they quit.
‚ÄúPeople want to talk about this virus as an equal opportunity pathogen, but it‚Äôs really not,‚Äù said Dr. Ashwin Vasan, a doctor and public health professor at Columbia University. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs going right to the fissures in our society.‚Äù
Gov. J.B. Pritzker of Illinois announced a stay-at-home order in his state on March 20 to combat the spread of the coronavirus. Charles Rex Arbogast/Associated Press
The mobility data provides a snapshot in time, and the behaviors it captures could change amid a fast-moving crisis. Although several public policy experts who reviewed the data said it strongly indicated that wealthier people are better able to stay home, they added that there could be other reasons for the differences ‚Äî perhaps higher awareness of the risks or better access to information, for example ‚Äî and others that are not yet obvious.
Economists and public health researchers said the data pointed to holes in the government‚Äôs response to the pandemic‚Äôs fallout for low-income workers, which has focused on those who have lost their jobs because of shutdowns and not on those with essential duties.
‚ÄúCovid-19 is exposing a lot of the structural disadvantages that low-income people face,‚Äù including a lack of job security and uneven access to health care, said Adie Tomer, a fellow at the Brookings Institution who has studied the essential work force. ‚ÄúThe well-off are employed in industries where they are at a desk, and so there are some advantages built into these high-income neighborhoods during this pandemic,‚Äù he added.
In metro areas with the greatest disparity between the richest and the poorest residents ‚Äî and where there are orders to stay home ‚Äî people in higher-income neighborhoods have essentially halted movement. People in lower-income neighborhoods have also drastically reduced their movement, but the data shows an uptick in their movements after the third weekend of March, coinciding with the start of another workweek.
Change in movement in metro areas with high income disparity
In other areas where income disparity was not as high, it was much more likely that both the richest and poorest continued to move. These cities were also in places that were less likely to have mandated that residents stay home.
Change in movement in metro areas with low income disparity
Many essential workers are in lower-income jobs and have positions that require them to leave home and work face-to-face with others, economists said. ‚ÄúThe people at this income, they‚Äôre either furloughed and not coming in to work, or they are essential construction, grocery cashiers, workers in long-term care institutions,‚Äù said Matthew Rae, who directs a program on health care markets at the Kaiser Family Foundation.
‚ÄúAnd hundreds of thousands of them don‚Äôt have health insurance.‚Äù
Ms. Benjamin, the health worker in Chicago‚Äôs Woodlawn neighborhood, is 26 and among those without health insurance. She carries bottled soap and hand sanitizer with her and is vigilant about not touching her face. But she is worried.
‚ÄúI do have gloves, but I just ran out of masks,‚Äù she said, ‚Äúand I have no idea where I‚Äôm going to get any from.‚Äù
Just 15 miles north of Ms. Benjamin, in the Uptown neighborhood, John Williams has been working at home since March 16, five days before the governor‚Äôs order went into effect. A communications worker for nonprofits, Mr. Williams said people on his team were already used to telecommuting but that his husband, a high school music teacher, had faced more challenges.‚ÄúHonestly, we are grateful for the privilege and security we have at the moment, knock on wood,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs uncomfortable, but it‚Äôs not life-threateningly scary.‚Äù

As federal lawmakers contend with shuttered businesses and millions of people suddenly out of work, little of their legislation has been tailored to help essential workers affected by the pandemic. These workers will get the same stimulus checks that other people get from the $2 trillion economic stabilization package, and the second phase of the coronavirus legislation expanded the mandate for paid sick leave related to Covid-19. But while Democrats have renewed their push to include expanded occupational safety requirements for workers, which failed to gain traction in the most recent legislation, and are also calling for additional hazard pay for workers on the front lines, it is unclear if either of those will prevail in future negotiations.
Mr. Tomer, of Brookings, said life insurance and targeted coronavirus-related health insurance for essential workers could help. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs about peace of mind for them and their families, and a form of compensation,‚Äù he said.
In reports from many cities, workers have alternated between fear at being exposed to the virus and relief at having a job while so many others are unemployed. Ridership on New York‚Äôs subway system has plummeted, but stations in poorer areas remain crowded.
In Seattle, one of the earliest coronavirus hotspots in the country, Cassandra Fejarang, a Teamsters union member, was laid off from her restaurant supply position in March but was able to find work in a Safeway grocery distribution center. She travels a few miles by car to the warehouse in Auburn, Wash.
‚ÄúI‚Äôm blessed to still be able to work,‚Äù said Ms. Fejarang, 34. She said she has been pulling 10- and 16-hour shifts, loading packs of frozen food, toilet paper, bleach and other goods onto pallets to be taken to stores. Grocery warehouse workers in her union make a good wage ‚Äî $20 to $29 an hour ‚Äî and have negotiated extra benefits during the coronavirus crisis.
‚ÄúI definitely wear gloves and try to keep my mask on because we‚Äôre surrounded by people all day,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúWe are all washing our hands, trying to keep our distance. It‚Äôs hard, but I feel safe when I‚Äôm there.‚Äù
Washington State, which had the earliest known major outbreak of coronavirus in the United States, stands out from the rest of the country because the wealthiest people there had nearly a week‚Äôs head start over the poorest when it came to staying home.
With this highly transmissible virus, even days can make a difference in limiting or igniting an outbreak, said Dr. Vasan, the Columbia professor.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just moving like wildfire through communities,‚Äù Dr. Vasan said. ‚ÄúWe talk about flattening the curve, and every day people are not staying home just makes that harder.‚Äù
When groups started to decrease their movement by half
Dr. Vasan and other public health experts cautioned that the nature of this virus means that inequality in health outcomes puts the entire population at greater risk. Pockets of people who are untested or who don‚Äôt get the appropriate medical treatment can quickly become new clusters.
Ms. Benjamin, the home care worker, said she was proud to be essential but would feel better with assurances that she could be taken care of if she fell ill.
‚ÄúI just really want people to understand that it‚Äôs hard right now to go to work and live for other people,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI want to make sure that they know we‚Äôre all in this together. Everyone is scared, but the world is in this together.‚Äù","['Jennifer Valentino-Devries', 'Denise Lu', 'Gabriel J.X. Dance']",2020-04-03 09:00:03

(LEX 18) ‚Äî A college senior from Versailles put her stir-craziness to good use with a project that will help the deaf and hard of hearing community.
""I just saw that people were making masks on Facebook for everyone to have instead of the throwaway masks, and I was like, what about the deaf and hard of hearing population?"" explained 21-year-old Ashley Lawrence.
Lawrence is a senior studying education for the deaf and hard of hearing at Eastern Kentucky University. Due to the virus, she is living back at home and doing her student teaching from home.
""I felt like there was a huge population that was being looked over,"" Lawrence said. ""We're all panicking right now and so a lot of people are just not being thought of. So, I felt like it was very important that, even at a time like this, people need to have that communication.""
After a conversation with her mom, they put their craft skills to work.
Ashley Lawrence (left) poses with her mother while they both wear a mask made for the deaf and hard of hearing community.
""We started out making them with bed sheets that we had, and luckily bed sheets are big,"" Lawrence said. ""So we have two or three sets so we're making them out of that. Then, a couple months ago we needed plastic fabric for something. And so we have a whole roll of that and the window is only this big so having a whole roll is very helpful so luckily we haven't needed any supplies yet.""
With her mission centered around the deaf and hard of hearing community, she is going the extra mile.
""We're trying different things to for people with cochlear implants and hearing aids if they can't wrap around the ears,"" Lawrence said. ""We're making some that have around the head and around the neck.""
She explained the necessity for the plastic window on the masks is why she started this project in the first place.
""For anyone who uses speech reading, lip reading, anybody like that,"" Lawrence said about the purpose of the masks. ""And people who are profoundly deaf who use ASL as their primary mode of communication. ASL is very big on facial expressions and it is part of the grammar. So I don't know if you have seen Virginia Moore on Andy Beshear's things at five o'clock, but she's very emotive, and if half of that is gone because you're wearing a mask then half of what you're saying is being missed, so even if it's not physically talking and just using ASL, then you need to have that kind of access.""
In less than two days, Lawrence already had dozens of orders from six states. To order one of Lawrence's masks, reach out to her at dhhmaskproject@gmail.com.
""I'm not charging anything for them because I think that if you need them, then you need them and I don't think that you should have to pay for them,"" Lawrence said. ""So we are sending them out for free whenever we have people asking for them and if they're foreign, then maybe we'll charge shipping, but other than that they're completely free.""
Those who would like to help Lawrence with the cost of materials and shipping, she is accepting donations on her GoFundMe page.",[],2020-03-31 17:51:59

Defined as ‚Äúpublic participation and collaboration in scientific research‚Äù, citizen science allows everyday people to use technology to unite towards a common goal ‚Äì from the comfort of their homes. And it is now offering a chance to contribute to research on the coronavirus pandemic.
With so many of us staying home, this could help build a sense of community where we may otherwise feel helpless, or struggle with isolation.
Read more: Can't sleep and feeling anxious about coronavirus? You're not alone
Anyone is welcome to contribute. You don‚Äôt need expertise, just time and interest. Projects exist in many forms, catering to people of diverse ages, backgrounds and circumstances. Many projects offer resources and guides to help you get started, and opportunities to collaborate via online discussion forums.
Ditch the news cycle ‚Äì engage, gain skills and make a difference
Scientists worldwide are racing to find effective treatments and vaccines to halt the coronavirus pandemic. As a citizen scientist, you can join the effort to help tackle COVID-19, and other infectious diseases.
Foldit is an online game that challenges players to fold proteins to better understand their structure and function. The Foldit team is now challenging citizen scientists to design antiviral proteins that can bind with the coronavirus.
The highest scoring designs will be manufactured and tested in real life. In this way, Foldit offers a creative outlet that could eventually contribute to a future vaccine for the virus.
Another similar project is Folding@home. This is a distributed computing project that, rather than using you to find proteins, uses your computer‚Äôs processing power to run calculations in the background. Your computer becomes one of thousands running calculations, all working together.
One way to combat infectious diseases is by monitoring their spread, to predict outbreaks.
Online surveillance project FluTracking helps track influenza. By completing a 10-second survey each week, participants aid researchers in monitoring the prevalence of flu-like symptoms across Australia and New Zealand. It could also help track the spread of the coronavirus.
Such initiatives are increasingly important in the global fight against emerging infectious diseases, including COVID-19.
Another program, PatientsLikeMe, empowers patients who have tested positive to a disease to share their experiences and treatment regimes with others who have similar health concerns. This lets researchers test potential treatments more quickly.
The program recently set up a community for people who have contracted COVID-19 and recovered. These individuals are contributing to a data set that could prove useful in the fight against the virus.
Environmental projects need your support too
If you‚Äôd like to get your mind off COVID-19, there‚Äôs a plethora of other options for citizen scientists. You can contribute to conservation and nature recovery efforts ‚Äì a task many took to after the recent bushfires.

Some sites ask volunteers to digitise data from ongoing environmental monitoring programs. Contributors need no prior experience, and interpret photos taken with remote digital cameras using online guides. One example is Western Australia‚Äôs Western Shield Camera Watch, available through Zooniverse.
Other sites crowdsource volunteers to transcribe data from natural history collections (DigiVol), historical logbooks from explorers, and weather observation stations (Southern Weather Discovery).
eBird
Citizen science programs such as eBird, BirdLife Australia‚Äôs Birdata, the Australian Museum‚Äôs FrogID, ClimateWatch, QuestaGame, NatureMapr, and the Urban Wildlife App, all have freely available mobile applications that let you contribute to ‚Äúbig‚Äù databases on urban and rural wildlife.
Nature watching is a great self-isolation activity because you can do it anywhere, including at home. Questagame runs a series of ‚Äúbioquests‚Äù where people of all ages and experience levels can photograph animals and plants they encounter.
In April, we‚Äôll also have the national Wild Pollinator Count. This project invites participants to watch any flowering plant for just ten minutes, and record insects that visit the flowers. The aim is to boost knowledge on wild pollinator activity.
The data collected through citizen science apps are used by researchers to explore animal migration, understand ranges of species, and determine how changes in climate, air quality and habitat affect animal behaviour.

This year for the first time, several Australian cities are participating in iNaturalist‚Äôs City Nature Challenge. The organisers have adapted planned events with COVID-19 in mind, and suggest ways to document nature while maintaining social distancing. You can simply capture what you can see in your backyard, or when taking a walk, or put a moth light out at night to see what it attracts.
Connecting across generations
For those at home with children, there are a variety of projects aimed at younger audiences.
From surveying galaxies to the Bird Academy Play Lab‚Äôs Games Powered By Birds - starting young can encourage a lifetime of learning.
If you‚Äôre talented at writing or drawing, why not keep a nature diary, and share your observations through a blog.
By contributing to research through digital platforms, citizen scientists offer a repository of data experts might not otherwise have access to. The Australian Citizen Science Association (ACSA) website has details on current projects you can join, or how to start your own.
Apart from being a valuable way to pass time while self-isolating, citizen science reminds us of the importance of community and collaboration at a time it‚Äôs desperately needed.","['Aaron Greenville', 'Alice Motion', 'Ayesha Tulloch', 'Cobi Calyx', 'Glenda Wardle', 'Rebecca Cross', 'Rosanne Quinnell', 'Samantha Rowbotham', 'Yun-Hee Jeon']",2020-03-27 00:00:00

Closer to normal travel No travel Half of normal Normal travel Closer to normal travel No travel Half of normal Normal travel
Stay-at-home orders have nearly halted travel for most Americans, but people in Florida, the Southeast and other places that waited to enact such orders have continued to travel widely, potentially exposing more people as the coronavirus outbreak accelerates, according to an analysis of cellphone location data by The New York Times.
The divide in travel patterns, based on anonymous cellphone data from 15 million people, suggests that Americans in wide swaths of the West, Northeast and Midwest have complied with orders from state and local officials to stay home. Disease experts who reviewed the results say those reductions in travel ‚Äî to less than a mile a day, on average, from about five miles ‚Äî may be enough to sharply curb the spread of the coronavirus in those regions, at least for now.
‚ÄúThat‚Äôs huge,‚Äù said Aaron A. King, a University of Michigan professor who studies the ecology of infectious disease. ‚ÄúBy any measure this is a massive change in behavior, and if we can make a similar reduction in the number of contacts we make, every indication is that we can defeat this epidemic.‚Äù
But not everybody has been staying home.
Which counties reduced travel the most
In areas where public officials have resisted or delayed stay-at-home orders, people changed their habits far less. Though travel distances in those places have fallen drastically, during the week of March 23 they were still typically more than three times those in areas that had imposed lockdown orders, the analysis shows.
A half-dozen of the most populous counties where residents were traveling widely were in Florida, where Gov. Ron DeSantis resisted calling for a statewide lockdown until April 1. People in Jacksonville, Tampa, Daytona Beach, Lakeland and surrounding areas continued to travel much more than people in other parts of the country, putting those areas at a higher risk for outbreaks in the coming weeks.
Where people were still traveling the most on March 27 Counties above 500,000 people Less travel More County Avg. travel F S S M T W T F S S M T W T F S S M T W T F S S M T W T F
In Jacksonville, the sheriff‚Äôs department had to send out officers over the weekend to break up block parties. In Spartanburg, S.C., people were still going to the hardware store to buy supplies for home-improvement projects, and pictures from children's birthday parties and playdates were being posted on Facebook. And along the shorelines in Florida and Alabama, communities that rely on tourists to help drive the economy instead looked with frustration at out-of-state license plates on the street.
‚ÄúI saw people this weekend shaking hands with each other,‚Äù Lenny Curry, the mayor of Jacksonville, Florida‚Äôs largest city, told residents. ‚ÄúI understand, maybe it's just habit. But we've got to stop, folks. We've really got to stop this.‚Äù
The location data, from Cuebiq, a data intelligence firm, measures the range that people travel each day. It cannot predict where outbreaks will spread, and it does not track how many interactions people had while they were traveling. Not all travel is problematic: A person driving for a few miles to pick up groceries would not be violating stay-at-home orders. And people in cities can infect others without traveling far.
But broadly higher levels of travel suggest more contact with others and more chances to spread or contract the disease, researchers said. Counties with lax travel policies risk not only becoming the next hot spots of the disease, but also acting as reservoirs for the virus that reignite infection in places that have tamped it down, they said.
Florida waited so long to shut down travel that it will struggle to control local outbreaks even if people immediately change their behavior significantly, said Thomas Hladish, an infectious disease modeler at the University of Florida. People who now sequester themselves at home still risk having brought the virus home to their families, he said.
""A lockdown order right now is not going to be a silver bullet with containing this,"" Mr. Hladish said. ""It will absolutely save lives. But in order to really have a big effect with social-distancing measures, you would have had to move it back in time.‚Äù
In Spartanburg, a city of 37,000 people in the northwest part of South Carolina, the City Council delayed putting into place any official order. ""I'd like to see us wait at least another couple of weeks for this discussion,"" one councilwoman, Ruth Littlejohn, said.
Erica Brown, another councilwoman in Spartanburg, has pushed for enacting limits, saying they were necessary because issuing simple cautions had not worked. ‚ÄúThey're going about their days as if nothing has changed,‚Äù she said of residents.
Ms. Brown acknowledged that the city ‚Äî which has undergone an economic rebirth in recent years ‚Äî and particularly locally owned businesses, would surely suffer by keeping people home. But she said she feared that waiting any longer may mean devastation down the line.
‚ÄúNow everyone is just trying to crawl their way back to the starting line,‚Äù she said, ‚Äúand we‚Äôre already behind in our response.‚Äù
On March 31, Gov. Henry McMaster of South Carolina issued an order closing businesses deemed nonessential, including entertainment venues, bingo halls, gyms and salons.
Other areas reduced travel weeks ago, the data show, especially in California, New York and Washington, which were the first to experience large outbreaks. Most people have essentially stopped traveling in those places for weeks, the data show, a sign that they are taking the measures seriously. Anthony S. Fauci, the nation‚Äôs leading infectious disease expert, said on March 31 that changes in behavior were already bringing down the level of new cases in those places.
When average distance traveled first fell below 2 miles By Mar. 16 Mar. 19 Mar. 24 Mar. 26 Not by Mar. 26 Data is through March 26. Only weekdays were counted, because almost everyone traveled less on weekends.
Disease experts said that a tenfold reduction in travel in many counties in the United States gave them hope that other places could have similar success, as long as the reductions remain in effect for an extended period and are implemented nationwide.
But even states and cities that were relatively early in setting restrictions did not significantly reduce travel until mid- to late March, leaving a path for the virus to make its way around the country. Control measures typically take two to three weeks to show an effect because of the time it takes for infected people to develop symptoms, seek medical care and get tested.
In New Orleans, where more than 2,000 people have been infected, travel was not reduced significantly until March 20, weeks after Mardi Gras brought huge crowds together. In Albany, Ga., a town of 75,000, travel reductions in recent weeks were too late to stop a cluster of illnesses that apparently emerged after a funeral in late February. Travel started declining only about two weeks ago in Indianapolis, Chicago, Miami and Phoenix, leaving room for continued growth last month.

The coronavirus outbreak is unprecedented in scale in recent history, and it is hard to know the exact relationship between changes in travel patterns and how quickly the virus spreads. Other factors play a big role, including how quickly sick people are tested and isolated, how closely people tend to congregate ‚Äî and luck.
Sheltering in place is protective and clearly reduces people‚Äôs contact with others, but the existing evidence that the policy can effectively contain an epidemic within a large population is uncertain, experts said.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs unprecedented, an extraordinarily disruptive natural experiment like this,‚Äù Mr. Hladish said. ‚ÄúWe have to look back to the influenza pandemic of 1918 for anything similar, and then of course the field of epidemiology was less well-developed, and we had nothing like the technology we do now.‚Äù
Working on the fly, scientists are assessing the results of different containment policies and their timing day by day ‚Äî and using those findings to advise regions that are not yet overwhelmed.
On March 26, Gov. Kay Ivey of Alabama resisted issuing a stay-at-home order as the outbreak appeared more acute and immediate in other states. ‚ÄúWe are not California,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúWe're not New York. We aren't even Louisiana.‚Äù But as the number of cases rose, she encouraged residents to limit social gatherings and ordered the closure of nonessential businesses. ‚ÄúThese are uncertain times, for sure,‚Äù she said in a televised speech ‚ÄúSo now, and for the foreseeable future, please, please consider staying safe at home.‚Äù
The inconsistencies in policies ‚Äî and in when they are imposed ‚Äî may create new problems, even for places that set limits weeks ago.
‚ÄúLet‚Äôs assume that we flatten the curve, that we push transmission down in the Bay Area and we walk away with 1 percent immunity,‚Äù said Dr. George Rutherford, a professor of epidemiology at the University of California, San Francisco. ‚ÄúThen, people visit from regions that have not sheltered in place, and we have another run of cases. This is going to happen.‚Äù
Even in Florida, where limits were announced on April 1, weeks after other places enacted them, some residents said their biggest worry was not locals, but visitors from other places.
Before the limits came into effect, Quanita J. May, a city commissioner in Daytona Beach, said her area was exceptionally quiet. Along the beaches and downtown, she said, ‚ÄúIt feels like it's Christmas or Thanksgiving, the three or four days when everybody is at home with their families.‚Äù
‚ÄúThe residents are self-quarantining,‚Äù she said, adding that her real concern was people coming from other places. They were the ones, she said, who were not staying put. ‚ÄúPeople are listening to the newscasts, they‚Äôre reading, and they‚Äôre paying attention,"" she said. ‚ÄúThis is here now.‚Äù","['James Glanz', 'Benedict Carey', 'Josh Holder', 'Derek Watkins', 'Jennifer Valentino-Devries', 'Rick Rojas', 'Lauren Leatherby']",2020-04-02 09:00:03

Key Points
This report provides a road map for navigating through the current COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. It outlines specific directions for adapting our public-health approach away from sweeping mitigation strategies as we limit the epidemic spread of COVID-19, such that we can transition to new tools and approaches to prevent further spread of the disease.
The authors outline the steps that can be taken as epidemic transmission is brought under control in different regions. They also suggest measurable milestones for identifying when we can make these transitions and start reopening America for businesses and families.
In each phase, the authors outline the steps that the federal government, working with the states and public-health and health care partners, should take to inform the response. This will take time, but planning for each phase should begin now so the infrastructure is in place when it is time to transition.
Executive Summary
This report provides a road map for navigating through the current COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. It outlines specific directions for adapting our public-health strategy as we limit the epidemic spread of COVID-19 and are able to transition to new tools and approaches to prevent further spread of the disease. We outline the steps that can be taken as epidemic transmission is brought under control in different regions. These steps can transition to tools and approaches that target those with infection rather than mitigation tactics that target entire populations in regions where transmission is widespread and not controlled. We suggest measurable milestones for identifying when we can make these transitions and start reopening America for businesses and families.
In each phase, we outline the steps that the federal government, working with the states and public-health and health care partners, should take to inform the response. This will take time, but planning for each phase should begin now so the infrastructure is in place when it is time to transition.
The specific milestones and markers included in the report for transitioning our responses are judgments based on our current understanding, with the goal of facilitating an effective path forward. The epidemic is evolving rapidly, and our understanding of best responses will evolve as well. The broad set of tasks described here requires and will receive high-level, ongoing attention, and it should be updated and refined as additional evidence, context, and insights about the epidemic become available.
To gradually move away from a reliance on physical distancing as our primary tool for controlling future spread, we need:
Better data to identify areas of spread and the rate of exposure and immunity in the population; Improvements in state and local health care system capabilities, public-health infrastructure for early outbreak identification, case containment, and adequate medical supplies; and Therapeutic, prophylactic, and preventive treatments and better-informed medical interventions that give us the tools to protect the most vulnerable people and help rescue those who may become very sick.
Our stepwise approach depends on our ability to aggregate and analyze data in real time. To strengthen our public-health surveillance system to account for the unprecedented spread of COVID-19, we need to harness the power of technology and drive additional resources to our state and local public-health departments, which are on the front lines of case identification and contact tracing. Finally, we must expand our investments in pharmaceutical research and development into COVID-19 and promote the rapid deployment of effective diagnostics, therapies, and eventually a vaccine.
Slow the Spread in Phase I. This is the current phase of response. The COVID-19 epidemic in the United States is growing, with community transmission occurring in every state. To slow the spread in this period,1 schools are closed across the country, workers are being asked to do their jobs from home when possible, community gathering spaces such as malls and gyms are closed, and restaurants are being asked to limit their services. These measures will need to be in place in each state until transmission has measurably slowed down and health infrastructure can be scaled up to safely manage the outbreak and care for the sick.
State-by-State Reopening in Phase II. Individual states can move to Phase II when they are able to safely diagnose, treat, and isolate COVID-19 cases and their contacts. During this phase, schools and businesses can reopen, and much of normal life can begin to resume in a phased approach. However, some physical distancing measures and limitations on gatherings will still need to be in place to prevent transmission from accelerating again. For older adults (those over age 60), those with underlying health conditions, and other populations at heightened risk from COVID-19, continuing to limit time in the community will be important.
Public hygiene will be sharply improved, and deep cleanings on shared spaces should become more routine. Shared surfaces will be more frequently sanitized, among other measures. In addition to case-based interventions that more actively identify and isolate people with the disease and their contacts, the public will initially be asked to limit gatherings, and people will initially be asked to wear fabric nonmedical face masks while in the community to reduce their risk of asymptomatic spread. Those who are sick will be asked to stay home and seek testing for COVID-19. Testing should become more widespread and routine as point-of-care diagnostics are fully deployed in doctors‚Äô offices.
While we focus on state-by-state reopening of activities in a responsible manner and based on surveillance data, we note that states may move forward at a county or regional level if these conditions vary within the state and that coordination on reopening among states that share metropolitan regions will be necessary.
Establish Immune Protection and Lift Physical Distancing During Phase III. Physical distancing restrictions and other Phase II measures can be lifted when safe and effective tools for mitigating the risk of COVID-19 are available, including broad surveillance, therapeutics that can rescue patients with significant disease or prevent serious illness in those most at risk, or a safe and effective vaccine.
Rebuild Our Readiness for the Next Pandemic in Phase IV. After we successfully defeat COVID-19, we must ensure that America is never again unprepared to face a new infectious disease threat. This will require investment into research and development initiatives, expansion of public-health and health care infrastructure and workforce, and clear governance structures to execute strong preparedness plans. Properly implemented, the steps described here also provide the foundation for containing the damage that future pathogens may cause.
Phase I: Slow the Spread
Goals
The goal of Phase I is to save lives by:
Slowing the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 across the United States by reducing the effective reproduction number of infections, Increasing testing capacity to accommodate the ability to test everyone with symptoms and their close contacts, and Ensuring the health care system has the capacity to safely treat both COVID-19 patients and others requiring care.
A successful Phase I will allow for a significant relaxation of physical distancing measures and a progression to Phase II, when more targeted, case-based interventions are possible.
Thresholds for Action
Trigger to Begin to ‚ÄúSlow the Spread.‚Äù The trigger to implement nationwide ‚Äúslow the spread‚Äù measures2 in Phase I is the existence in multiple geographic locations around the country of confirmed cases that cannot be traced back to other known cases (‚Äúcommunity spread‚Äù).3 This trigger has already been reached in the United States.
Trigger to Move to Phase II. To guard against the risk that large outbreaks or epidemic spread could reignite once we lift our initial efforts to ‚Äúslow the spread,‚Äù the trigger for a move to Phase II should be when a state reports a sustained reduction in cases for at least 14 days (i.e., one incubation period); and local hospitals are safely able to treat all patients requiring hospitalization without resorting to crisis standards of care4; and the capacity exists in the state to test all people with COVID-19 symptoms, along with state capacity to conduct active monitoring of all confirmed cases and their contacts.5
Stay-at-Home Advisories The trigger for issuing a stay-at-home advisory6 in a US state is when case counts are doubling every three to five days7 (based on the current New York experience) or when state and local officials recommend it based on the local context (for example, growth on track to overwhelm the health system‚Äôs capacity). The trigger for issuing a recommendation to step down from a stay-at-home-advisory back to ‚Äúslow the spread‚Äù is when the number of new cases reported in a state has declined steadily for 14 days (i.e., one incubation period) and the jurisdiction is able to test everyone seeking care for COVID-19 symptoms.
Steps Required in Phase I
Maintain Physical Distancing. Each state must maintain community-level physical distancing measures8 until the threshold for moving to Phase II is met. These Phase I measures include:
Closing community gathering spaces such as schools, shopping centers, dining areas, museums, and gyms statewide (places where people congregate indoors);
Promoting telework for nonessential employees statewide;
Urging the public to limit unnecessary domestic or international travel;
Canceling or postponing meetings and mass gatherings;
Shutting dining areas but encouraging restaurants to provide takeout and delivery services if possible;
Issuing stay-at-home advisories in hot spots where transmission is particularly intense (i.e., when case counts are doubling in a city or locality every three to five days); and
Monitoring community adherence to physical distancing and stay-at-home advisories, adjusting risk messaging as appropriate, and identifying alternative incentives for compliance if needed.
Increase Diagnostic Testing Capacity and Build Data Infrastructure for Rapid Sharing of Results. Same-day, point-of-care diagnostic testing (widely available in outpatient settings) is crucial for identifying cases, including those with asymptomatic and mild infections. To move from community-wide interventions that focus on large populations to case-based interventions that target and isolate individual people who are infected, capacity should be sufficient to test:
Hospitalized patients (rapid diagnostics are needed for this population); Health care workers and workers in essential roles (those in community-facing roles in health and public safety); Close contacts of confirmed cases; and Outpatients with symptoms. (This is best accomplished with point-of-care diagnostics in doctors‚Äô offices with guidelines that encourage widespread screening and mandated coverage for testing.)
We estimate that a national capacity of at least 750,000 tests per week would be sufficient to move to case-based interventions when paired with sufficient capacity in supportive public-health infrastructure (e.g., contact tracing).9 In conjunction with more widespread testing, we need to invest in new tools to make it efficient for providers to communicate test results and make data easily accessible to public-health officials working to contain future outbreaks.
Ensure Functioning of the Health Care System. Ensure sufficient critical-care capacity10 in hospitals to be able to immediately expand capacity from 2.8 critical-care beds per 10,000 adults to 5‚Äì7 beds per 10,000 adults in the setting of an epidemic or other emergency, allowing for regional variation.11 This target is a minimum, must be adequate for the current and forecasted level of demand, and must be accompanied by adequate staffing. Regional variation in capacity reflecting local needs is acceptable.
Expand access to ventilators in hospitals from 3 per 10,000 adults to a goal of 5‚Äì7 ventilators per 10,000 adults.12 This target does not include transport or anesthesia machines. This target is a minimum, must be adequate for the current and forecasted level of demand, and must be accompanied by adequate staffing. Regional variation in capacity reflecting local needs is acceptable.
Maintain access to acute-care hospital beds of at least 30 per 10,000 adults.13 Facilities should have a plan, in the case of a surge in hospital demand, for how the beds would be rapidly flexed from more discretionary uses (e.g., elective procedures) and adequately staffed, with access to adequate supplies of oxygen and other medical supplies.
This health care functioning target would also be met if critical-care and ventilator capacity does not expand to that level but COVID-19 incidence is maintained or falls meaningfully below the state‚Äôs capacity to meet critical-care demand. These capacity targets can also be partially met through the availability of ample mobile health care infrastructures (supported and perhaps maintained by federal or state governments) that can be distributed and set up on short notice to hot areas with surge capacity needs.
Increase Supply of Personal Protective Equipment. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends, at a minimum, N95 respirators for hospital staff expected to have direct contact with COVID-19 patients, plus disposable procedural or surgical masks for all other clinical personnel in any health care setting.14 The supply chain should be able to reliably distribute sufficient N95 masks, gloves, and other personal protective equipment to protect health care workers from infection.
Implement Comprehensive COVID-19 Surveillance Systems. The move toward less restrictive physical distancing could precipitate another period of acceleration in case counts. Careful surveillance will be needed to monitor trends in incidence. A high-performing disease surveillance system should be established that leverages:
Widespread and rapid testing at the point of care using cheaper, accessible, and sensitive point-of-care diagnostic tools that are authorized by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA); Serological testing to gauge background rates of exposure and immunity to inform public-health decision-making about the level of population-based mitigation required to prevent continued spread in the setting of an outbreak; and A comprehensive national sentinel surveillance system, supported by and coordinated with local public-health systems and health care providers, to track the background rate of infection across states and identify community spread while an outbreak is still small and at a stage in which case-based interventions can prevent a larger outbreak.
ILINet, the surveillance system for influenza-like illness in the United States, is a potential model for SARS-CoV-2 surveillance. To enable rapid and more effective detection and case management, SARS-CoV-2 surveillance will also benefit from data sharing and coordination with health care providers and payers. The CDC should convene an intergovernmental task force, with outside experts as needed and input from states and the health care community, to develop and support a new national surveillance system and data infrastructure for tracking and analyzing COVID-19.
Massively Scale Contact Tracing and Isolation and Quarantine. When a new case of COVID-19 is diagnosed, the patient should be isolated either at home or in a hospital, depending on the level of care he or she requires. Current CDC guidelines recommend seven days of isolation.15 Home isolation can be enforced using technology such as GPS tracking on cell phone apps. Also, the close contacts of confirmed cases (as defined by the CDC16) should be quarantined and monitored daily for 14 days. Monitoring of international travelers is also recommended.17
To scale these interventions to accommodate thousands of daily cases and tens of thousands of daily contacts, public-health infrastructure will need to be dramatically scaled up throughout the country, in coordination with the improving capacity of health care providers to prevent, diagnose, and treat COVID-19 cases.
The task force should also be charged with developing and overseeing an initiative to:
Surge the existing public-health workforce to conduct case finding and contact tracing; Enable rapid reporting to state, local, and federal health authorities, through the public-health workforce and electronic data sharing from health care providers and labs; and Develop and field a technological approach to enable rapid data entry, reporting, and support for isolation, quarantine, and safe community-based treatment of affected individuals.
Offer Voluntary Local Isolation and Quarantine. Comfortable, free facilities should be provided for cases and their contacts who prefer local isolation, quarantine, and treatment away from home. For example, a member of a large household may wish to recover in a hotel room that has been repurposed rather than risk infecting family members. Isolation and quarantine away from home should not be mandatory or compelled by force.
The Federal Emergency Management Agency is the lead agency tasked with coordinating with state and local jurisdictions to stand up appropriate isolation and quarantine facilities. Field hospitals, dormitories, hotels, and military barracks may be appropriated for this purpose.
Encourage the Public to Wear Masks. There is emerging evidence that asymptomatic and presymptomatic transmission of COVID-19 is possible,18 which complicates efforts to pursue case-based interventions. To reduce this risk during Phase I, everyone, including people without symptoms, should be encouraged to wear nonmedical fabric face masks while in public.19
Face masks will be most effective at slowing the spread of SARS-CoV-2 if they are widely used, because they may help prevent people who are asymptomatically infected from transmitting the disease unknowingly. Face masks are used widely by members of the public in some countries that have successfully managed their outbreaks, including South Korea and Hong Kong.20 The World Health Organization (WHO) recommended members of the public use face masks in the event of a severe influenza pandemic.21
However, personal protective equipment should continue to be reserved for health care workers until supplies are sufficient for them and abundant. For this reason, right now members of the general public should opt to wear nonmedical fabric face masks when going out in public. The CDC should issue guidelines on the proper design of such nonmedical fabric face masks. Consumers may be able to fashion these masks themselves using available washable materials, or they may become available in the consumer marketplace.
Trigger for Moving to Phase II
A state can safely proceed to Phase II when it has achieved all the following:
A sustained reduction in cases for at least 14 days,
Hospitals in the state are safely able to treat all patients requiring hospitalization without resorting to crisis standards of care, 22
The state is able to test all people with COVID-19 symptoms, and
The state is able to conduct active monitoring of confirmed cases and their contacts.23
Phase II: Reopen, State by State
In Phase II, the majority of schools, universities, and businesses can reopen. Teleworking should continue where convenient; social gatherings should continue to be limited to fewer than 50 people wherever possible. Other local restrictions should be considered, such as those that limit people from congregating in close proximity.
High-contact settings such as schools should continue to review and implement physical distancing measures with guidance from the CDC and input from local officials. Health officials should recommend increased social hygiene measures and cleaning of shared surfaces.
For older adults (those over 60 years old), those with underlying health conditions, and other populations at heightened risk from COVID-19, it should still be recommended that they limit time in the community during Phase II. This recommendation may change if an effective therapeutic becomes available.
We need to consider these activities on a coordinated, regional basis through multistate cooperation. While state and local governments maintain sovereignty over issues related to their public-health response, coordination based on regions that cross state boundaries will be crucial. Large states with multiple urban areas and rural regions may implement reopening at a regional level. States that share major metropolitan areas (for example, New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut) should assure that the conditions for reopening these areas are met across the relevant state boundaries.
Goals
The goals of Phase II are to:
Lift strict physical distancing measures in a concerted and careful fashion, Allow the vast majority of businesses and schools to open, and Continue to control SARS-CoV-2 transmission so we do not revert back to Phase I.
The adoption of these Phase II measures will require a careful balance. We will need to constantly reevaluate the implementation of these measures based on available surveillance data, and we will need to be ready to adjust our approach over time according to the epidemiology of local, national, and global spread. This is especially true as we transition from one phase to the next.
Thresholds for Action
Trigger to Lift Physical Distancing Measures. Once the criteria for the transition from Phase I to Phase II have been met and we begin to move away from the ‚Äúslow the spread‚Äù period, leaders at the state level should begin an incremental easing of physical distancing measures. This should be done gradually and should be paired with increased surveillance for new cases. State officials should make decisions about the selection and timing of restrictions to lift based on their local contexts. Restrictions should be eased gradually, with sufficient time between each adjustment to carefully monitor for resurgence of transmission.
Trigger for Returning to Phase I, ‚ÄúSlow the Spread.‚Äù As physical distancing is gradually eased, surveillance will be essential for quickly identifying an increase in cases in the state. A state should revert to Phase I and continue ‚Äúslow the spread‚Äù if a substantial number of cases cannot be traced back to known cases, if there is a sustained rise in new cases for five days, or if hospitals in the state are no longer able to safely treat all patients requiring hospitalization.
Trigger for Moving to Phase III. Once a vaccine has been developed, has been tested for safety and efficacy, and receives FDA emergency use authorization,24 or there are other therapeutic options that can be used for preventive or treatment indications and that have a measurable impact on disease activity and can help rescue very sick patients, states can move to Phase III.
Steps Required in Phase II
Implement Case-Based Interventions. Using the public-health capacities developed in Phase I, every confirmed case should be isolated either at home, in a hospital, or (voluntarily) in a local isolation facility for at least seven days, or according to the latest CDC guidance. People awaiting test results should be advised to quarantine until their results are returned.
The close contacts of confirmed cases should be traced and placed under home or central quarantine, with active daily monitoring for at least 14 days, or according to the latest CDC guidance. Diagnostic tests should be immediately administered to any close contacts who develop symptoms.
Begin to Relax Physical Distancing Measures. General physical distancing precautions should still be the norm during Phase II, including teleworking (as much as possible), maintaining hand hygiene and respiratory etiquette, wearing a mask in public, regularly disinfecting high-touch surfaces, and initially limiting social gatherings to fewer than 50 people. These recommendations should be augmented through technological solutions to understand physical distancing behaviors and adjust risk messaging as needed. This should be accomplished through partnerships with the private sector, with careful attention paid to preserving privacy and avoiding coercive means to encourage compliance.
As children return to school and daycare (i.e., high-contact settings) and people return to high-density workplaces, leaders of these organizations should continue to review and implement physical distancing measures based on guidance from the CDC for schools and businesses.25
Special Care for Vulnerable Populations. While easing of physical distancing is taking place, highly vulnerable populations,26 such as individuals older than age 60 and those with compromised immune systems or compromised lung and heart function, should continue to engage in physical distancing as much as possible until a vaccine is available, an effective treatment is available, or there is no longer community transmission. Special attention should be paid to long-term-care facilities and nursing homes.27 These facilities will need to maintain high levels of infection prevention and control efforts and limit visitors to prevent outbreaks.
If a treatment or prophylactic, such as a monoclonal antibody,28 becomes available, high-risk and vulnerable populations should be prioritized to receive it, to both protect those individuals and reduce the likelihood of an increase in severe illnesses and additional patient surge in hospital intensive care units (ICUs).
Accelerate the Development of Therapeutics. Therapeutics play an important role in caring for those who are sick. Accelerating the research, development, production, and distribution of safe and effective therapeutics is a top priority. With effective development strategies and early investments in commercial-scale manufacturing, a successful therapeutic could receive emergency use authorization or approval as early as the summer or fall, if trials demonstrate that it meets either standard.
Therapeutics can serve a number of roles. First, they can serve as a prophylaxis to help prevent infection in those at greatest risk of infection, such as front-line health care workers, or those at risk of bad outcomes, such as individuals with preexisting health conditions and those who are immunocompromised. Such a treatment could include a recombinant antibody that can target the virus surface antigens. As an example, researchers successfully developed such a therapeutic against Ebola. These antibody drugs can also be used to treat early infection or as a postexposure prophylaxis.
Other therapeutics might include antiviral drugs that target features of how the virus replicates. These drugs can be used to treat people who are critically ill or earlier in the course of disease for those at risk of developing a complication. Antiviral drugs can also be used as postexposure prophylaxis, depending on their safety profile. Postexposure prophylaxis and products that shorten the duration and intensity of viral shedding may affect the effective reproduction number only modestly. In addition, immune-modulating treatments may prove to be helpful in mitigating severe lung complications in some patients. A number of promising drugs are in early and mid-stage development.
At a minimum, the optimal profile for a therapeutic that will affect the risk from future spread is one that meaningfully reduces the risk of death or severe disease and perhaps prevents the onset of symptoms or progression to severe disease in those exposed. Oral administration at the outpatient level would be ideal, but alternative administration requirements (e.g., infusion and jet injections) could also be scaled, with sufficient planning.
While private industry has already organized a large task force to share information and capabilities to rapidly advance promising therapies, we need a commensurate focus by federal agencies to make sure the best possible resources are brought to this mission. Federal agencies should join organized efforts already underway in the private sector.
Identify Those Who Are Immune. Serology is a method used to identify evidence of immunity in someone who has recovered from infection. With accurate and widely available serological testing, we can identify people who are immune and therefore no longer vulnerable to infection. While we need to better understand the strength of the immune response in mild cases and how long people remain immune from reinfection, we know there is a period where most people will have sufficient antibodies to offer protection. People who are immune could:
Return to work, Serve in high-risk roles such as those at the front lines of the health care system, and Serve in roles that support community functioning for people who are still physically distancing (e.g., the elderly who continue to quarantine at home).
To use serology in this way, serological assays are needed and should be widely available, accurate, rapid, and low cost. Such assays have already been developed by researchers, but they have not yet been fully validated and are not available at scale.
A task force comprised of senior leaders from the CDC, the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, the Department of Defense (DOD), the FDA, academia, and key private-sector groups (e.g., serological manufacturing companies) should be tasked to oversee the development, production, distribution, data collection, serological survey designs, and analytics for use of serology at scale.29
Trigger for Moving to Phase III
Once a vaccine has been developed, has been tested for safety and efficacy, and receives FDA emergency use authorization,30 states can move to Phase III.
Phase III: Establish Protection Then Lift All Restrictions
Once a robust surveillance sentinel system is in place, coupled with widespread point-of-care testing and a robust ability to implement tracing, isolation, and quarantines‚Äîand this is supported by the availability of therapeutics that can help mitigate the risk of spread or reduce serious outcomes in those with infections‚Äîor alternatively a vaccine has been developed and tested for safety and efficacy, we can enter Phase III. The availability of these technologies (and eventually a safe and effective vaccine) will have economic and social benefits, in addition to health benefits.
Goals
The goals of safe and effective technologies for controlling transmission are to:
Prevent infection; Treat those with early disease to prevent bad outcomes; Provide a prophylaxis for those exposed to infection to prevent them from developing disease or reduce its severity; In the case of a vaccine, build population-level immunity to the virus in order to reduce illness and death and stop or greatly slow spread; and Enable the lifting of all physical distancing measures.
Thresholds for Action
Trigger to Begin Manufacturing Scale-Up and Vaccine or Therapeutic Prioritization Planning. As soon as a vaccine or therapeutic looks promising in pivotal clinical trials (i.e., it has been shown to be safe and looks like it will also be effective),31 the US government should work with industry to begin planning for mass manufacturing, distribution, and administration. New provisions enacted under the recently passed the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act allow for large-scale manufacturing of promising therapies, in advance of approval, to help make sure there will be adequate supply available for mass distribution, should a product demonstrate that it is safe and effective and win regulatory approval.
Trigger for Switch Toward Mass Vaccination. Once availability of a vaccine or therapeutic is able to meet demand, vaccination can expand beyond priority groups. The CDC, state public-health agencies, and vaccine developers should work together to plan for and execute mass vaccination of large populations in the US. This planning can begin before Phase III because preparation can be made regardless of vaccine availability.
Steps to Take in Phase III
Vaccine or Therapeutic Production. Once a safe and effective vaccine or therapeutic has been licensed, it will need to be quickly manufactured at scale. The Public Health Emergency Medical Countermeasures enterprise,32 in coordination with pharmaceutical companies and other private-sector stakeholders, should continue to plan for and implement mass production capable of quickly meeting US demand.
Vaccine or Therapeutic Prioritization‚ÄîWhen Supply Is Still Limited. The CDC, the National Institutes of Health, the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response, the DOD, and other stakeholders should revise prior influenza vaccine prioritization guidance to apply specifically to COVID-19.33 The new prioritization guidance for the COVID-19 vaccine should identify priority groups for targeted distribution when a safe and effective vaccine starts to become available. The guidance should be transparent and explain the reasoning for priorities, including the populations in which the vaccine was studied, and should be a phased approach that expands to additional priority groups as vaccine availability expands. The guidance should be reflected in COVID-19 payment policies implemented by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) and private insurers, with treatment available at no cost to individuals who meet the priority guidance and a mechanism for reimbursement for individuals who are uninsured.
Mass Vaccination or Therapeutic Distribution‚ÄîWhen Supply Is Abundant. The CDC should work with state and local health officials, health care providers, CMS and health insurers, and other public-health stakeholders to create a national plan for how mass vaccination will be carried out across the country. This plan should identify who will administer vaccinations, where vaccines will be offered, and how data will be collected on vaccination rates, as well as possible adverse events from the vaccine. Indemnification of vaccine developers and manufacturers should also be considered. Congress could enact legislation to support a process for compensation of any individual who has an adverse event from the vaccine, which requires medical care.
Global Vaccine Scale-Up and Vaccination. The CDC, the US Agency for International Development, the State Department, and other US stakeholders should continue to work with WHO and other international organizations and national leaders to plan for how the US will assist other countries (particularly low- and middle-income countries) with obtaining vaccine and implementing mass vaccination. Support from the United States and higher-income nations will be critical for controlling the virus globally and saving lives around the world, as well as reducing the impact that future waves of the pandemic may have on the US population.
Serological Surveys to Determine Population Immunity. One key input for understanding the population at risk is the fraction of the population who have recovered and are protected against reinfection. If a sufficiently high fraction of the population has become immune either through natural recovery or vaccination, remaining restrictions can be lifted. The CDC should be the lead agency for coordinating ongoing serological surveys.
Phase IV: Rebuild Our Readiness for the Next Pandemic
The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed serious gaps in our nation‚Äôs pandemic preparedness. COVID-19 will not be the last public-health emergency to threaten American society. We must invest in the scientific, public-health, and medical infrastructure needed to prevent, detect, and respond to the next infectious disease threat.
Develop Vaccines for Novel Viruses in Months, Not Years. In response to COVID-19 and in preparation for the next previously unidentified health threat (‚ÄúDisease X‚Äù34), the United States should lead the way by setting an ambitious goal of rapidly developing medical countermeasures for novel or unknown threats in months, not years. A dedicated strategy, program, and funding will be needed to create the ability at existing agencies within the US Department of Health and Human Services and DOD to quickly develop flexible platforms and countermeasures for any type of novel pathogen.35 This strategy should include supporting flexible manufacturing capacity to scale up production to a global level in an emergency.
Modernize and Fortify the Health Care System. We must improve our hospital-bed and ICU capacity to accommodate large surges of patients through public-private partnerships, for example, by enhancing the Hospital Preparedness Program36 and the Public Health Emergency Preparedness Cooperative Agreement37 and emphasizing preparedness in federal health care programs (e.g., the CMS38 and the Department of Veterans Affairs39). We must also expand the supply chain of personal protective equipment and further the development of crisis standards of care. To reduce future burdens on our critical-care systems, we must also support our primary and community care capabilities to identify populations at elevated risk, detect cases early, and manage them at home or in the community more effectively. Health care payers have been implementing payment reforms to support better screening and population health management. Emergency supplemental payments to health care providers in the current pandemic and future health care payments should be linked to establishing better surge capacity for severe cases and stronger capabilities to partner with public-health authorities to contain outbreaks and reduce the burden on hospitals.
Establish a National Infectious Disease Forecasting Center. Given the important role of infectious disease modeling in supporting public-health decision-making, we should increase our nation‚Äôs capacity to use infectious disease modeling40 to support public-health decision-making by establishing a national infectious disease forecasting center. This permanent federal institution would function similarly to the National Weather Service, providing a centralized capability for both producing models and undertaking investigations to improve methods used to advance basic science, data science, and visualization capabilities. It would also provide decision support to public-health agencies based on modeling and analytic results.
Governance. We need to move away from a decentralized system that promotes unequal implementation of preparedness measures across the nation and toward a more coordinated execution of response. We should develop clear and effective plans for the implementation of public-health measures such as quarantine and the unification of actions made by state and local health departments. Outbreaks are matters of regional‚Äîand more typically national‚Äîconcern. Preparedness for public-health emergencies should be elevated as a function in the White House, with a coordinating function analogous to the director of national intelligence.

9. During the 2017‚Äì18 flu season (which was particularly severe), there were 18,000,000‚Äì27,000,000 medical visits for influenza-like illness spread out over approximately 32 weeks, averaging 562,000‚Äì844,000 visits per week. However, those visits were not evenly distributed throughout the season, and peak demand was higher, so we estimate a national capacity of approximately 750,000 would meet demand. South Korea has tested 1 in 170 people, cumulatively. To do the same, we would need to test 1.9 million people, which we could achieve in around 2.5 weeks with a capacity of 750,000/week.

Bezos said Amazon is already supporting WHO with IT support and providing AI to help its epidemic-mapping tools.
‚ÄúWe also discussed the urgent need for collective action to produce and distribute plentiful COVID-19 test kits,‚Äù Bezos said.
Amazon has already agreed to deliver COVID-19 kits in the UK.
Visit Business Insider‚Äôs homepage for more stories.
Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos posted to Instagram on Thursday to say he‚Äôd held a video call with the director-general of the World Health Organisation (WHO), Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.
In his post, Bezos listed the ways Amazon is mobilizing to help WHO in its response to the coronavirus pandemic.
According to Bezos, Amazon has already provided web support to WHO, helped integrate artificial intelligence tech into its mapping of the pandemic, and helped translate WHO‚Äôs materials.
‚ÄúOur current work with WHO includes: increasing capacity and security for the WHO website; providing ML [machine learning] & AI for WHO‚Äôs Epidemic Intelligence from Open Sources initiative; assisting with the translation and transcription of WHO‚Äôs knowledge catalogue; providing logistics support,‚Äù wrote Bezos.
It‚Äôs not entirely clear what ‚Äúlogistics support‚Äù entails, although Amazon‚Äôs fleets of delivery drivers could be diverted to help WHO.
Bezos also hinted that Amazon could help to deliver test kits.
‚ÄúWe also discussed the urgent need for collective action to produce and distribute plentiful COVID-19 test kits,‚Äù he wrote. ‚ÄúA surplus of fast, effective, easy-to-access test kits would flatten the curve and protect people around the world. I told Dr. Tedros we will continue to help WHO in every way we can in the coming weeks and months.‚Äù
In the UK, Amazon has agreed to deliver millions of at-home COVID-19 tests, starting with healthcare workers then broadening out to the general public.
Unlike many other Silicon Valley billionaires, Bezos hasn‚Äôt made any public statements about whether he is donating any of his personal fortune towards the fight against the coronavirus. Bezos remains the richest person in the world, with a net worth of $120 billion.
His last piece of public communication about the virus was a letter addressed to Amazon‚Äôs warehouse workers, many of whom have voiced concerns about the steps the company is taking to safeguard their health. ‚ÄúMy own time and thinking is now wholly focused on COVID-19 and how Amazon can best play its role,‚Äù Bezos wrote in the letter.
Warehouse workers in at least 10 US warehouses have now tested positive for the virus.",[],2020-03-27 11:01:14

We've now updated our data with several new indicators. The CSV download reflects this and version two of the API is now live. Please read what changed.
Systematic information on which governments have taken which measures, and when, can help decision-makers and citizens understand the robustness of governmental responses in a consistent way, aiding efforts to fight the pandemic. The Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT) systematically collects information on several different common policy responses governments have taken, scores the stringency of such measures, and aggregates these scores into a common Stringency Index.
Data is collected from public sources by a team of over one hundred Oxford University students and staff from every part of the world.
Stringency Index
OxCGRT collects publicly available information on 17 indicators of government responses. Eight of the policy indicators (C1-C8) record information on containment and closure policies, such as school closures and restrictions in movement. Four of the indicators (E1-E4) record economic policies, such as income support to citizens or provision of foreign aid, and five indicators (H1-H5) record health system policies such as the COVID-19 testing regime or emergency investments into healthcare. Read the working paper for a full description of the data and how it is collected, and see our codebook on GitHub for the most up-to-date description of indicators.
We‚Äôve also looked at what the data tells us about countries‚Äô readiness to exit lockdown and how closely they meet WHO guidelines in this research note.
The tracker aggregates the policy scores (not the financial scores) into a common ‚ÄòStringency Index‚Äô. Note that this index simply records the number and strictness of government policies, and should not be interpreted as ‚Äòscoring‚Äô the appropriateness or effectiveness of a country‚Äôs response. A higher position in the Stringency Index does not necessarily mean that a country's response is ‚Äòbetter‚Äô than others lower on the index.
Data
You can access the full dataset using our API or download a CSV of the latest data. Our codebook on Github explains the definitions for each variable. The data is also available in timeseries form and you can read about our calculation of the Stringency Index. These CSVs are also posted to GitHub, where we have additional notes and guidance on data quality for people exploring the underlying dataset.

I am speaking to all of you from the front line here in Italy, mainly in Florence Tuscany. As you all may know, I am a surgeon and emergency physician and, since 2002, the Clinical Risk Manager for the Florence Healthcare Trust. When the COVID-19 outbreak occurred I felt the necessity to go back to front line and help my collegues, nurses and intensivits, and other specialties to treat the enormous amount of COVD-19 positive symptomatic patients in very severe conditions needing invasive ventilation and/or supported by NIV or CPAP procedures.
Dear Colleagues and friends
I am speaking to all of you from the front line here in Italy, mainly in Florence Tuscany. As you all may know, I am a surgeon and emergency physician and, since 2002, the Clinical Risk Manager for the Florence Healthcare Trust. When the COVID-19 outbreak occurred I felt the necessity to go back to front line and help my collegues, nurses and intensivits, and other specialties to treat the enormous amount of COVD-19 positive symptomatic patients in very severe conditions needing invasive ventilation and/or supported by NIV or CPAP procedures.
Believe me, we are experiencing a very dramatic situation and need to be helped and supported. All of us professionals on the front line are exhausted and very tired because we are on the job for many hours and days on a continuous basis. Some of my colleagues haven't been able to leave the hospital since 24th February!!! They are on a continuous shift and dealing with a number of severe respiratory distress cases caused by coronovirus, as severe interstitial pneumonia and deaths are an everyday issue.
On Tuesday, 24th March I have been invited by ISQua to give a Webinar, scheduled at 11:00 a.m. Italian time, to give a testimony of what's happening in my country and specifically in Tuscany. I am very honoured to share my experience.
ISQua and INSH (Italian Network for Safety in Healthcare - Italian ISQua chapter) are about to release a paper of recommendations to healthcare professionals dealing on the front line with COVID patients. This paper will list some general and specific recommendations based on evidence-based data and the experience of frontline workers who everyday give feedback of the situation.
I believe that we all need substantial recommendations ,free of bureaucracy, mainly because we don't have the time to read books or very long papers; we need substantial advice of what to do in terms of self-protection; and psychologically we are all near to burnout status and need psychological support.
I felt the necessity of sharing this with all you prestigious professionals of healthcare worldwide, some of you I had the honour of meeting personally, these everyday issues that are a grief on nurses, doctors and other healthcare workers, besides of course our patients, their families and friends, and the entire Italian healthcare system which is close to a breakdown.
Now, I am aware it has become a global issue, and this means we are farther obliged to support healthcare systems worldwide with practical and concrete suggestions to help decision-making on the front line.
What I have observed in the recent 2 months is a failure in situation awareness and communication leading to a consequent unsuccess of leadership and teamwork. We are now aware of this and trying to struggle to come up with solutions. Our regional government and the patient safety center of Tuscany are trying to support us with organizational strategies which are very hard to realize and we appreciate all the efforts, being myself part of this system; but we experienced a very severe and unjustifiable lack of protection devices for nurses and doctors: a severe lack of masks (all of them), a severe lack of vital supporting devices and many other criticalities and this means that none of the leaders in healthcare institutions dealing with preventive strategies ever took this into consideration.
We also need to reinforce our personnel: we need more doctors and nurses on the front line, and this will also be the need shortly in other countries.
Such a severe pandemic episode should have been foreseen and many data prove this. We are now working under very severe conditions and are exposed to contamination ourselves. Is this a strategic way of dealing with such mass casualty? As Dr Dhingra says in her mail ""this is an unprecedented situation"", this is correct and I fully agree, I also would like to share with you all a personal consideration: could we have done better? and, as a risk manager may I say: after all this is over and life comes back to routine, what lessons have we learned from this and where should we address improvement strategies.
I apologize for having occupied your time with my considerations but I have been working for the last 8 days continuously, I am tired and need a rest, but I needed to share with all of you my personal experience in this health catastrophe.
My best to all of you and thank you for allowing me to be part of your prestigious organization.

But what happens to this post-pandemic is uncertain.
Unfortunately, the pandemic‚Äôs spatial isolation converted quickly into social isolation, and this created stress and anxiety for many. All of this means that after the pandemic, there will be a surge in demand for mental health services.
Read more: How to manage your blood pressure in isolation
This extra demand will put still more pressure on an already overloaded mental health system.
Digital help is on hand
It‚Äôs crucial that public and private mental health services adopt new technologies now to help meet this future demand.
Compelled by the massive health services dislocation accompanying the COVID-19 pandemic, Medicare this year finally moved to support for the most basic form of telehealth, supporting both telephone and video consultations.
That‚Äôs 144 years since Alexander Graham Bell produced the first working telephone in 1876. Let‚Äôs hope it doesn‚Äôt take quite as long for our general health care system, and particularly our mental health system, to incorporate the power of 21st-century digital technologies.

Australians are fortunate to have already benefited from many innovations in digital mental health care, such as moodgym, eHeadspace and Project Synergy, all offering online support to people in need.
This has been led by partnerships between major universities, non-government organisations and industry.
ReachOut was the world‚Äôs first online service when it launched in Australia in 1996 to reduce youth suicide.
Slow uptake of telehealth services
But telehealth systems have not been widely deployed or accessed. Of the 2.4 million visits to psychiatrists in 2018-19, only 66,000 involved telehealth.
Clearly too many Australians who seek mental health care do not gain the potential benefits of what‚Äôs available in telehealth innovation.
This failure is not unique to Australia. Pre-COVID-19, the World Economic Forum highlighted the massive gap in mental health service provision between developed and developing countries. It‚Äôs calling for rapid deployment of smarter, digitally enhanced health services.
The World Health Organization and every other major health body is warning of the urgent need to expand mental health services in response to the economic and social dislocation caused by the pandemic.
The cruel lesson of past economic recessions is that for people hit hardest, mental health deteriorates rapidly. Without a swift and targeted response, suicide attempts and death by suicide will increase.
A boost to the system
To prevent this in Australia, we need widespread social and welfare investments and a better mental health system.
Pre-COVID-19, the Productivity Commission in its draft report on Australian mental health care highlighted a lack of sustained investment (relative to the social and economic costs of poor mental health), poor coordination and a fundamental lack of responsiveness to the needs of those most affected.
It also called for more prevention and early intervention measures, particularly for children and young adults.
Australia has two separate mental health systems. State-based systems are highly focused on emergency departments and acute and compulsory care. These benefit principally the smaller number of people with very severe and persisting illnesses.
Private hospitals provide additional hospital beds to people with private health insurance, but also support day programs that cost a lot but provide limited value.
The upshot is that Australia has a missing middle ‚Äì big service gaps for the people most in need of care.
We need more specialised but outpatient care and multidisciplinary care for those in need. That means GPs, psychiatrists, psychologists, nurses and other skilled health workers, working in coordinated team structures. These services are desperately needed in outer urban, regional and rural communities.
A digital future, now!
A digitally enhanced, 21st century-style mental health service may be the answer.
Smart digital systems, such as smartphone apps and other technologies, can help to assess quickly the level of need and direct people to the best available clinics.
They can help our highly talented mental health professionals provide better care. They also bring the world of other tools, peer support and enhanced social connections to the client, no matter where they are located.
Access to online forms of cognitive-behavioural therapy, such as those offered by Mindspot, THIS WAY UP and other evidence-based psychological interventions can be delivered to meet demand.
These innovations can bring real expertise to the lounge room of those in rural and regional areas who typically live most distant from quality face-to-face care.
In one of our research trials, a child and adolescent psychiatrist operating in Bogota, Colombia, was able to provide same-day specialised assessments to young people in Broken Hill, New South Wales.
Mental health services in Australia have already been radically transformed during the pandemic. Video-style consultations are now central to the work of mental health professionals.
Psychologists and psychiatrists all around the country are reaching out to their clients online. Many clients find it much more convenient and far less costly than attending regular clinics.
Time to act
The digital future is not just about making small changes. A digitally enhanced future for mental health involves a fundamental rethinking of models of care.
Read more: What can you use a telehealth consult for and when should you physically visit your GP?
Online or helpline-supported screening tools should be used to guide people along the best, evidence-based treatment path for them.
Primary health networks ‚Äì the regional health authorities funded by the commonwealth to coordinate primary care ‚Äì should ensure the services they commission are using digital technology appropriately and tracking the provision of care.
These new forms of digitally enabled care will make the whole mental health system more efficient, freeing up resources to help the backlog of Australians who need more intensive clinical care.
Australia‚Äôs governments must seize the opportunity that COVID-19 has created. Digital systems must now be viewed as essential health infrastructure, so that the most disadvantaged Australians move to the front of the queue.","['Ian Hickie', 'Stephen Duckett']",2020-05-06 00:00:00

In about 20% of patients, severe symptoms occur after a mean incubation period of 5 - 6 days; 5% of patients need intensive care therapy. Morbidity is about 1 - 2%. Protecting health care workers is of paramount importance in order to prevent hospital acquired infections. Therefore, during all procedures associated with aerosol production, a personal safety equipment consisting of a FFP2/FFP3 (N95) respiratory mask, gloves, safety glasses and a waterproof overall should be used. Therapy is based on established recommendations issued for patients with acute lung injury (ARDS). Lung protective ventilation, prone position, restrictive fluid management and an adequate management of organ failures are the mainstays of therapy. In case of fulminant lung failure, veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation may be used as a rescue in experienced centres. New, experimental therapies evolve with ever increasing frequency; currently, however, there is no evidence based recommendation possible. If off-label and compassionate use of these drugs is considered, an individual benefit-risk assessment is necessary, since serious side effects have been reported.","['Bein B Bachmann M Huggett S Wegermann P', 'Kluge S', 'Janssens U', 'Welte T', 'Weber-Carstens S', 'Marx G', 'Karagiannidis C.', 'Et Al.', 'Zhan Wq', 'Li Md']",2020-04-13 00:00:00

We strongly recommend a multidisciplinary approach while tackling the challenges that ICUs and hospitals encounter with the management and treatment of COVID-19 patients. Aside from intensive care physicians and nurses, infectious disease and infection control specialists need to be part of the team.
Transmission of SARS-CoV‚Äë2 usually occurs via droplet infection during close contact.

Currently, the World Health Organization (WHO) has defined the infection as a global pandemic and there is a health and social emergency for the management of this new infection. While most people with COVID-19 develop only mild or uncomplicated illness, approximately 14% develop severe disease that requires hospitalization and oxygen support, and 5% require admission to an intensive care unit. In severe cases, COVID-19 can be complicated by the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), sepsis and septic shock, and multiorgan failure. This consensus document has been prepared on evidence-informed guidelines developed by a multidisciplinary panel of health care providers from four Spanish scientific societies (Spanish Society of Intensive Care Medicine [SEMICYUC], Spanish Society of Pulmonologists [SEPAR], Spanish Society of Emergency [SEMES], Spanish Society of Anesthesiology, Reanimation, and Pain [SEDAR]) with experience in the clinical management of patients with COVID-19 and other viral infections, including SARS, as well as sepsis and ARDS. The document provides clinical recommendations for the noninvasive respiratory support (noninvasive ventilation, high flow oxygen therapy with nasal cannula) in any patient with suspected or confirmed presentation of COVID-19 with acute respiratory failure.
This consensus guidance should serve as a foundation for optimized supportive care to ensure the best possible chance for survival and to allow for reliable comparison of investigational therapeutic interventions as part of randomized controlled trials.",[],2020-04-16 00:00:00

A continuaci√≥n, se presentan las recomendaciones de ¬´no hacer¬ª para el manejo del paciente cr√≠tico, elaboradas por los respectivos GT de la SEMICYUC.
Grupo de Trabajo de Bio√©tica
Recomendaci√≥n 1: no practicar limitaci√≥n de tratamientos de soporte vital sin una valoraci√≥n completa de la situaci√≥n cl√≠nica, pron√≥stico y valores del paciente La limitaci√≥n de tratamientos de soporte vital (LTSV) es buena pr√°ctica cl√≠nica, mantener tratamientos f√∫tiles no es √©tico y supone obstinaci√≥n terap√©utica. Es por ello que dichas actuaciones han de ser conocidas por el paciente y sus allegados, adem√°s de constar de forma expl√≠cita en la historia cl√≠nica. Las decisiones de LTSV han de ser juicios prudentes, preferentemente consensuados en equipo y fundamentados en la situaci√≥n cl√≠nica, respuesta a tratamientos, pron√≥stico y valores de los pacientes. No es conveniente tomar decisiones de LTSV en situaciones de incertidumbre y no deber√≠an ser tomadas de forma individual, haciendo part√≠cipe a la enfermer√≠a y otros especialistas implicados. En casos de dudas o desacuerdos dentro del equipo asistencial, ha de consultarse a los comit√©s de √©tica asistencial7,8.
Recomendaci√≥n 2: no considerar los cuidados paliativos ajenos a la medicina intensiva Cl√°sicamente, pudiera considerarse que la medicina intensiva y los cuidados paliativos comprend√≠an 2disciplinas diametralmente opuestas. En la medicina moderna este concepto est√° superado y los cuidados al final de la vida son frecuentes en los servicios de Medicina Intensiva. Por tanto, no se deben tomar decisiones de LTSV sin contar con un plan de cuidados paliativos centrado en el mayor bienestar del paciente, facilitando tratamiento para el control de s√≠ntomas, el acompa√±amiento familiar y ofreciendo apoyo espiritual con base en las creencias y valores del paciente9,10.
Recomendaci√≥n 3: no tratar al paciente cr√≠tico sin su consentimiento ni sin consultar las voluntades vitales anticipadas en casos de incapacidad El consentimiento informado se fundamenta en el principio de autonom√≠a del paciente, por lo que no se deben realizar procedimientos diagn√≥sticos ni instaurar tratamientos sin obtener consentimiento para ello. En casos de incapacidad del paciente para tomar decisiones, la consulta de voluntades vitales es necesaria respetando su contenido. El consentimiento informado no debe ser considerado un mero tr√°mite burocr√°tico. Los profesionales sanitarios deben velar por su aplicaci√≥n adecuada teniendo en cuenta la situaci√≥n cl√≠nica del paciente e identificar a sus representantes si este no puede consentir. El consentimiento informado ha de realizarse en un ambiente adecuado, con una informaci√≥n veraz y comprensible, ofreciendo la posibilidad de revocarlo libremente en cualquier momento. La inclusi√≥n de pacientes en estudios de investigaci√≥n deber√° realizarse con el consentimiento de estos o sus representantes en caso de incapacidad11,12.
Recomendaci√≥n 4: no retirar medidas de soporte vital en muerte encef√°lica sin ofrecer la posibilidad de donaci√≥n La donaci√≥n de √≥rganos y tejidos es un derecho de todos los ciudadanos y debe ofertarse a los pacientes en los cuidados al final de la vida. Este ofrecimiento no es exclusivo de los enfermos que desarrollan muerte encef√°lica, siendo extensible a los casos de LTSV. En estas situaciones, las decisiones de LTSV han de ser independientes del coordinador de trasplantes13. En los casos que ingresen en la UCI con la finalidad exclusiva de la donaci√≥n, los familiares deber√°n ser informados verazmente para no generarles falsas expectativas.","['Gonz√°lez De Molina Ortiz', 'Fgonzalez Mutuaterrassa.Es', 'Gordo Vidal', 'Estella Garc√≠a', 'Morrondo Valdeolmillos', 'Fern√°ndez Ortega', 'Caballero L√≥pez', 'P√©rez Villares', 'Ballesteros Sanz', 'De Haro L√≥pez']",2018-10-01 00:00:00

The incubation period for COVID-19 is thought to extend to 14 days, with a median time of 4-5 days from exposure to symptoms onset.1-3 One study reported that 97.5% of persons with COVID-19 who develop symptoms will do so within 11.5 days of SARS-CoV-2 infection.3
Presentation
The signs and symptoms of COVID-19 present at illness onset vary, but over the course of the disease, most persons with COVID-19 will experience the following1,4-9:
Fever (83‚Äì99%)
Cough (59‚Äì82%)
Fatigue (44‚Äì70%)
Anorexia (40‚Äì84%)
Shortness of breath (31‚Äì40%)
Sputum production (28‚Äì33%)
Myalgias (11‚Äì35%)
Atypical presentations have been described, and older adults and persons with medical comorbidities may have delayed presentation of fever and respiratory symptoms.10,11 In one study of 1,099 hospitalized patients, fever was present in only 44% at hospital admission but later developed in 89% during hospitalization.1 Headache, confusion, rhinorrhea, sore throat, hemoptysis, vomiting, and diarrhea have been reported but are less common (<10%).1,4-6 Some persons with COVID-19 have experienced gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea and nausea prior to developing fever and lower respiratory tract signs and symptoms.9 Anosmia or ageusia preceeding the onset of respiratory symptoms has been anecdotally reported12, but more information is needed to understand its role in identifying COVID-19.
Several studies have reported that the signs and symptoms of COVID-19 in children are similar to adults and are usually milder compared to adults.13-17 For more information on the clinical presentation and course among children, see Information for Pediatric Healthcare Providers.
Asymptomatic and Pre-Symptomatic Infection
Several studies have documented SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients who never develop symptoms (asymptomatic) and in patients not yet symptomatic (pre-symptomatic).14,16,18-28 Since asymptomatic persons are not routinely tested, the prevalence of asymptomatic infection and detection of pre-symptomatic infection is not well understood. One study found that as many as 13% of RT-PCR-confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in children were asymptomatic.14 Another study of skilled nursing facility residents infected with SARS-CoV-2 from a healthcare worker demonstrated that half were asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic at the time of contact tracing evaluation and testing.26 Patients may have abnormalities on chest imaging before the onset of symptoms.20,21 Some data suggest that pre-symptomatic infection tended to be detected in younger individuals and was less likely to be associated with viral pneumonia.20,21
Asymptomatic and Pre-Symptomatic Transmission
Epidemiologic studies have documented SARS-CoV-2 transmission during the pre-symptomatic incubation period20,29-31, and asymptomatic transmission has been suggested in other reports.22,23,32 Virologic studies have also detected SARS-CoV-2 with RT-PCR low cycle thresholds, indicating larger quantities of viral RNA, and cultured viable virus among persons with asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection.19,24,26,33 The exact degree of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA shedding that confers risk of transmission is not yet clear. Risk of transmission is thought to be greatest when patients are symptomatic since viral shedding is greatest at the time of symptom onset and declines over the course of several days to weeks.33-36 However, the proportion of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in the population due to asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic infection compared to symptomatic infection is unclear.37
Clinical Course
Illness Severity
The largest cohort of >44,000 persons with COVID-19 from China showed that illness severity can range from mild to critical38:
Mild to moderate (mild symptoms up to mild pneumonia): 81%
Severe (dyspnea, hypoxia, or >50% lung involvement on imaging): 14%
Critical (respiratory failure, shock, or multiorgan system dysfunction): 5%
In this study, all deaths occurred among patients with critical illness and the overall case fatality rate was 2.3%.38 The case fatality rate among patients with critical disease was 49%.38 Among children in China, illness severity was lower with 94% having asymptomatic, mild or moderate disease, 5% having severe disease, and <1% having critical disease.14 Among U.S. COVID-19 cases with known disposition, the proportion of persons who were hospitalized was 19%.39 The proportion of persons with COVID-19 admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) was 6%.39
Clinical Progression
Among patients who developed severe disease, the medium time to dyspnea ranged from 5 to 8 days, the median time to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) ranged from 8 to 12 days, and the median time to ICU admission ranged from 10 to 12 days.5,6,10,11 Clinicians should be aware of the potential for some patients to rapidly deteriorate one week after illness onset. Among all hospitalized patients, a range of 26% to 32% of patients were admitted to the ICU.6,8,11 Among all patients, a range of 3% to 17% developed ARDS compared to a range of 20% to 42% for hospitalized patients and 67% to 85% for patients admitted to the ICU.1,4-6,8,11 Mortality among patients admitted to the ICU ranges from 39% to 72% depending on the study.5,8,10,11 The median length of hospitalization among survivors was 10 to 13 days.1,6,8
Risk Factors for Severe Illness
Age is a strong risk factor for severe illness, complications, and death.1,6,8,10,11,38-41 Among more than 44,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in China, the case fatality rate was highest among older persons: ‚â•80 years: 14.8%, 70‚Äì79 years: 8.0%, 60‚Äì69 years: 3.6%, 50‚Äì59 years: 1.3%, 40‚Äì49 years: 0.4%, <40 years: 0.2%.38,42 Early U.S. epidemiologic data suggests that the case fatality was highest in persons aged ‚â•85 years (range 10%‚Äì27%), followed by 3%‚Äì11% for ages 65‚Äì84 years, 1%‚Äì3% for ages 55‚Äì64 years, and <1% for ages 0‚Äì54 years.39
Patients in China with no reported underlying medical conditions had an overall case fatality of 0.9%, but case fatality was higher for patients with comorbidities: 10.5% for those with cardiovascular disease, 7.3% for diabetes, and approximately 6% each for chronic respiratory disease, hypertension, and cancer.42 Heart disease, hypertension, prior stroke, diabetes, chronic lung disease, and chronic kidney disease have all been associated with increased illness severity and adverse outcomes.1,6,10,11,38,42,43 Accounting for differences in age and prevalence of underlying condition, mortality associated with COVID-19 in the United States was similar to China.39,40,44
Medications
It has been hypothesized that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) may increase the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 severity.45 ACE inhibitors and ARBs increase the expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). SARS-CoV-2 uses the ACE2 receptor to enter into the host cell. There are no data to suggest a link between ACE inhibitors or ARBs with worse COVID-19 outcomes. The American Heart Association (AHA), the Heart Failure Society of America (HFSA), and the American College of Cardiology (ACC) released a statement recommending continuation of these drugs for patients already receiving them for heart failure, hypertension, or ischemic heart disease.46
It has also been hypothesized that non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may worsen COVID-19. Currently, there are no data suggesting an association between COVID-19 clinical outcomes and NSAID use. More information can be found at Healthcare Professionals: Frequently Asked Questions and Answers.
Reinfection
There are no data concerning the possibility of re-infection with SARS-CoV-2 after recovery from COVID-19. Viral RNA shedding declines with resolution of symptoms, and may continue for days to weeks.11,33,34 However, the detection of RNA during convalescence does not necessarily indicate the presence of viable infectious virus. Clinical recovery has been correlated with the detection of IgM and IgG antibodies which signal the development of immunity.36,47-49
Viral Testing
Diagnosis of COVID-19 requires detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Detection of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA is better in nasopharynx samples compared to throat samples.33,50 Lower respiratory samples may have better yield than upper respiratory samples.33,50. SARS-CoV-2 RNA has also been detected in stool and blood.13,34,47,51 Detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in blood may be a marker of severe illness.52 Viral RNA shedding may persist over longer periods among older persons and those who had severe illness requiring hospitalization. (median range of viral shedding among hospitalized patients 12‚Äì20 days).11,33-36
Infection with both SARS-CoV-2 and with other respiratory viruses has been reported, and detection of another respiratory pathogen does not rule out COVID-19.53

Laboratory and Radiographic Findings
Laboratory Findings
Lymphopenia is the most common lab finding in COVID-19 and is found in as many as 83% of hospitalized patients.1,5 Lymphopenia, neutrophilia, elevated serum alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase levels, elevated lactate dehydrogenase, high CRP, and high ferritin levels may be associated with greater illness severity.1,5,6,8,11,54 Elevated D-dimer and lymphopenia have been associated with mortality.8,11 Procalcitonin is typically normal on admission, but may increase among those admitted to the ICU.4-6 Patients with critical illness had high plasma levels of inflammatory makers, suggesting potential immune dysregulation.5,55
Radiographic Findings
Chest radiographs of patients with COVID-19 typically demonstrate bilateral air-space consolidation, though patients may have unremarkable chest radiographs early in the disease.1,5,56 Chest CT images from patients with COVID-19 typically demonstrate bilateral, peripheral ground glass opacities.4,8,38,56-65 Because this chest CT imaging pattern is non-specific and overlaps with other infections, the diagnostic value of chest CT imaging for COVID-19 may be low and dependent upon interpretations from individual radiologists.57,66 One study found that 56% of patients who presented within 2 days of diagnosis had a normal CT58. Conversely, other studies have also identified chest CT abnormalities in patients prior to the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA.56,67 Given the variability in chest imaging findings, chest radiograph or CT alone is not recommended for the diagnosis of COVID-19. The American College of Radiology also does not recommend CT for screening or as a first-line test for diagnosis of COVID-19. (See American College of Radiology Recommendationsexternal icon).
Clinical Management and Treatment
Mild to Moderate Disease
Patients with a mild clinical presentation (absence of viral pneumonia and hypoxia) may not initially require hospitalization, and many patients will be able to manage their illness at home. The decision to monitor a patient in the inpatient or outpatient setting should be made on a case-by-case basis. This decision will depend on the clinical presentation, requirement for supportive care, potential risk factors for severe disease, and the ability of the patient to self-isolate at home. Patients with risk factors for severe illness (see People Who Are at Higher Risk for Severe Illness) should be monitored closely given the possible risk of progression to severe illness in the second week after symptom onset.5,6,10,11
For information regarding infection prevention and control recommendations, please see Interim Infection Prevention and Control Recommendations for Patients with Confirmed Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) or Persons Under Investigation for COVID-19 in Healthcare Settings.
Severe Disease
Some patients with COVID-19 will have severe disease requiring hospitalization for management. No specific treatment for COVID-19 is currently FDA approved. Corticosteroids have been widely used in hospitalized patients with severe illness in China6,8,10,11; however, the benefit of corticosteroid use cannot be determined based upon uncontrolled observational data. By contrast, patients with MERS-CoV or influenza who were given corticosteroids were more likely to have prolonged viral replication, receive mechanical ventilation, and have higher mortality.68-72 Therefore, corticosteroids should be avoided unless indicated for other reasons, such as management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation or septic shock. More information can be found at Healthcare Professionals: Frequently Asked Questions and Answers.
Inpatient management revolves around the supportive management of the most common complications of severe COVID-19: pneumonia, hypoxemic respiratory failure/ARDS, sepsis and septic shock, cardiomyopathy and arrhythmia, acute kidney injury, and complications from prolonged hospitalization including secondary bacterial infections, thromboembolism, gastrointestinal bleeding, and critical illness polyneuropathy/myopathy.1,4-6,10,11,38,73-76

Investigational Therapeutics
No FDA-approved drugs have demonstrated safety and efficacy in randomized controlled trials for patients with COVID-19. Use of investigational therapies for treatment of COVID-19 should ideally be done in the context of enrollment in randomized controlled trials. Several clinical trials are underway testing multiple drugs with in-vitro antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 and/or immunomodulatory effects that may have clinical benefit. For the latest information, see Information for Clinicians on Therapeutic Options for COVID-19 Patients. For the information on registered trials in the U.S., see ClinicalTrials.govexternal icon.
Discontinuation of Transmission-Based Precautions or Home Isolation
Patients who have clinically recovered and are able to discharge from the hospital but who have not been cleared from their Transmission-Based Precautions may continue isolation at their place of residence until cleared. For recommendations on discontinuation of Transmission-Based Precautions or home isolation for patients who have recovered from COVID-19 illness, please see: Interim Guidance for Discontinuation of Transmission-Based Precautions and Disposition of Hospitalized Patients with COVID-19 , Interim Guidance for Discontinuation of In-Home Isolation for Patients with COVID-19 , and Discontinuation of In-Home Isolation for Immunocompromised Persons with COVID-19 .

A patient treated in a hospital near Paris on 27 December for suspected pneumonia actually had the coronavirus, his doctor has said.
This means the virus may have arrived in Europe almost a month earlier than previously thought.
Dr Yves Cohen said a swab taken at the time was recently tested, and came back positive for Covid-19.
The patient, who has since recovered, said he had no idea where he caught the virus as he had not travelled abroad.
Knowing who was the first case is key to understanding how the virus spread.
The World Health Organization (WHO) says it is possible more early cases will come to light, and spokesman Christian Lindmeier urged countries to check records for similar cases in order to gain a clearer picture of the outbreak.
The French health ministry told the BBC that the government was obtaining confirmation on the case and that it would consider further investigations if they proved necessary.
France is not the only country where subsequent testing points to earlier cases. Two weeks ago, a post-mortem examination carried out in California revealed that the first coronavirus-related death in the US was almost a month earlier than previously thought.
What do we know about the new case?
Dr Cohen, head of emergency medicine at Avicenne and Jean-Verdier hospitals near Paris, said the patient was a 43-year-old man from Bobigny, north-east of Paris.
He told the BBC's Newsday programme that the patient must have been infected between 14 and 22 December, as coronavirus symptoms take between five and 14 days to appear.
The patient, Amirouche Hammar was admitted to hospital on 27 December exhibiting a dry cough, a fever and trouble breathing - symptoms which would later become known as main indications of coronavirus.
This was four days before the WHO's China country office was informed of cases of pneumonia of unknown cause being detected in the Chinese city of Wuhan.
Mr Hammar told French broadcaster BFMTV that he had not left France before falling sick. Dr Cohen said while two of the patient's children had also fallen ill, his wife had not shown any symptoms.
But Dr Cohen pointed out that the patient's wife worked at a supermarket near Charles de Gaulle airport and could have come into contact with people who had recently arrived from China. The patient's wife said that ""often customers would come directly from the airport, still carrying their suitcases"".
""We're wondering whether she was asymptomatic,"" Dr Cohen said.
What does it tell us?
Could coronavirus have been circulating in Europe in late 2019, many weeks before it was officially recognised and declared a threat there? That is the suggestion being made after a French doctor has revealed that he treated a patient in Paris with all of the symptoms of coronavirus just after Christmas.
How does this change what we know about the pandemic? It might be that the test result is an error and so does not change a thing.
But it if is correct, it could mean spread of the disease was going unchecked in Europe while all eyes were on the East in Wuhan.
Certainly, any laboratories in Europe with samples from patients sick with similar symptoms around that time might want to run a test for coronavirus to see what it reveals so that we can learn more about this new disease.
Why does it matter?
Until now, what were thought to have been the France's first three cases of coronavirus were confirmed on 24 January. Of those, two had been to Wuhan - where the outbreak was first detected - and the third was a close family member.
Mr Hammar's positive test result suggests the virus was present in France much earlier.
The first human-to-human transmission within Europe had until now thought to have been a German man who was infected by a Chinese colleague who visited Germany between 19 and 22 January.
Rowland Kao, a professor of veterinary epidemiology and data science at the University of Edinburgh, said that if confirmed, Mr Hammar's case highlighted the speed at which an infection starting in a seemingly remote part of the world could quickly seed infections elsewhere.
""It means that the lead time we have for assessment and decision-making can be very short,"" Prof Kao said.
How was the new case found?
Dr Cohen told the BBC that he had the idea to look back at all patients who had been in intensive care units with suspected pneumonia between 2 December and 16 January.
He found 14 patients who had tested negative for pneumonia. He defrosted their samples and tested them for traces of Covid-19.
Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Coronavirus: What is a vaccine and how is one made?
He said that out of the 14 samples, one tested positive for traces of Covid-19. A second test on that same sample also came back positive. He added that the patient's chest scan was also compatible with the symptoms of Covid-19.
A full report was due later this week, and would be published by the International Journal of Antimicrobial Agents, Dr Cohen added.",[],2020-05-05 12:37:37

Il virus era tra di noi da mesi, ma non lo sapevamo. Io sono stata contagiata a dicembre, ma soltanto pochi giorni fa ho scoperto aver avuto il Covid, dopo aver fatto il test sierologico. L'ho avuto, ma non sono entrata, non entro, in nessuna statistica e di casi come il mio chiss√† quanti ce ne sono"".fa l'operatrice culturale. Organizza eventi, fiere di libri, mostre. Si sente male il 24 dicembre, al ritorno da un viaggio in Africa con suo figlio. ""Una febbre fortissima, con un inizio di polmonite che mi √® stata curata con paracetamolo e cortisone e per fortuna √® rientrata in tempi brevi. Una specie di influenza molto violenta, cos√¨ mi aveva detto la mia dottoressa di base. Era dicembre, nessuno, da noi, parlava ancora del coronavirus "", Silvia si riprende, tra gennaio e febbraio va pi√π volte a Milano per lavoro.
Lo speciale L'Italia riparte
In poche settimane per√≤ il Covid diventa uno spettro mondiale. Inizia, anche, la tragedia italiana, i morti in Lombardia. ""Il 6 marzo, due giorni prima che iniziasse il lockdown, ho fatto il tampone allo Spallanzani. In quelle settimane ero andata cinque volte a Milano, in Lombardia la situazione era gi√† grave, mi era sembrato prudente. Sono risultata negativa"".Poi, la quarantena. ""Ci siamo chiusi in casa, come hanno fatto tutti gli italiani. Ero serena, il tampone era negativo. Ma qualche giorno fa, mio figlio che ha diciassette anni ha avuto una febbre molto forte. A quel punto abbiamo deciso di fare tutti, in famiglia, i testi sierologici in un laboratorio privato. E io ho scoperto di avere gli anticorpi del Covid, sono positiva alle, che testimoniano un contatto con il virus lontano nel tempo"".Dunque, ricostruisce Silvia, ""la violentissima febbre di dicembre era il Covid 19"", e il contagio non sarebbe avvenuto a Milano, ""ma in Africa, nel viaggio verso la Tanzania probabilmente"". Su quel volo infatti, insieme a Silvia e suo figlio, viaggiano decine di famiglie cinesi che ormai vivono stabilmente in Tanzania. √à avvenuto l√¨ il contagio? Forse.Ma quello che Silvia Barbagallo vuole testimoniare √® che i contagi del coronavirus in Italia sono stati assai pi√π numerosi delle statistiche ufficiali. ""I dati che da due mesi leggiamo e ascoltiamo non sono attendibili o meglio danno una rappresentazione incompleta dello scenario complesso. Se mappassero tutti, scopriremmo di averlo gi√† avuto in tanti e soprattutto che questo virus era in circolo gi√† mesi prima dell'inizio di questa tragedia collettiva"".Perch√© √® una tragedia quella che abbiamo vissuto e stiamo vivendo. E riprendendo il post su Facebook scritto da Silvia Barbagallo a cui decine di persone hanno risposto, √® questo il tempo di riflettere. ""Abbiamo vissuto in un grande ""corpo collettivo"" senza permetterci di ascoltare ognuno il proprio perch√© avevamo davanti agli occhi il dramma di tutti i pazienti in terapia intensiva, le enormi fatiche dei medici e degli infermieri, il dramma che stava attraversando le vite di tutti. Per√≤ quelle paure e quelle sensazioni di impotenza in qualche luogo si sono depositate e forse ora √® arrivato il momento di riappropriarci anche di una riflessione personale senza per forza sentirci in colpa. Una riflessione non solo legata al corpo ma anche alle paure che abbiamo vissuto, ai diritti, al futuro, al lavoro"".",['Di Michele Bocci'],2020-05-04 19:16:00

The virologists at the Pasteur Institute in Paris have sequenced the genomes from samples taken from 97 French and three Algerian coronavirus patients between January 24 and March 24.
What they found is that the dominant types of Covid-19 viral strains in France differed from those that arrived from China or Italy, and belonged to another group, or 'clade.'
The earliest sample in the French clade dated from February 19 and came from an infected person who hadn't traveled abroad recently and had no contacts with possible carriers of the disease.

""We can infer that the virus was silently circulating in France in February"" prior to the wave of Covid-19 cases in the country, the virologists said in a paper, published on bioRxiv website but not yet peer-reviewed.
The origins of this third strain were unknown to the scientists. They also pointed out that their sampling was insufficient to reliably establish the time of its introduction in France.
The first coronavirus-related fatality was registered in the country in mid-February, with 129,859 people confirmed as infected and 23,660 dying from complications related to the highly contagious disease since then.

The disease later identified as COVID-19 was first reported by Chinese authorities to the WHO on Dec. 31 and was not previously believed to have spread to Europe until January.
‚ÄúThis gives a whole new picture on everything,‚Äù WHO spokesman Christian Lindmeier told a U.N. briefing in Geneva, referring to the French report.
‚ÄúThe findings help to better understand the potential virus circulation of COVID-19,‚Äù he added, saying other earlier cases could emerge after retesting samples.
A French hospital which retested old samples from pneumonia patients discovered that it treated a man who had COVID-19 as early as Dec. 27, nearly a month before the French government confirmed its first cases.
There is not currently any suggestion that the virus emerged from anywhere other than Wuhan, China. It is thought that, instead, the French case was somehow connected to a person who travelled from there in December before the virus had been identified or reported by China, the WHO spokesman said.
However, the French patient, a fishmonger, is not thought to have a direct link to China or a history of recent travel and experts say the French case requires more investigation.
Lindmeier encouraged other countries to check records for pneumonia cases of unspecified origin in late 2019, since this would give a ‚Äúnew and clearer picture‚Äù of the outbreak.
Asked about the origins of the virus in China, Lindmeier stressed that it was ‚Äúreally, really important‚Äù to explore this.

U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo says his country has evidence that the new coronavirus emerged from a laboratory in Wuhan, although scientists have advised the WHO that it is of animal origin.
‚ÄúThat may need further missions or a mission (to China) so we are looking forward to this,‚Äù Lindmeier said.
The WHO‚Äôs top emergencies expert, Dr Mike Ryan, said on Monday that the body‚Äôs chief had raised the issue of the origins of the virus ‚Äúat the highest level‚Äù during a WHO mission to China in January.","['Emma Farge', 'Min Read']",2020-05-05 15:50:42

A man identified as the patient told a French TV station that he was surprised to learn that he had contracted COVID-19 since he thought he had flu at the time.
French researchers led by Yves Cohen, head of resuscitation at the Avicenne and Jean Verdier hospitals, retested samples from 24 patients treated in December and January who had tested negative for flu before COVID-19 developed into a pandemic.
The results, published in the International Journal of Antimicrobial Agents, showed that one patient - a 42-year-old man born in Algeria, who had lived in France for many years and worked as a fishmonger - was infected with COVID-19 ‚Äúone month before the first reported cases in our country‚Äù, they said.
The World Health Organization said the results were ‚Äúnot surprising‚Äù.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs also possible there are more early cases to be found,‚Äù WHO spokesman Christian Lindmeier told a U.N. briefing in Geneva. He encouraged other countries to check records for cases in late 2019, saying this would give the world a ‚Äúnew and clearer picture‚Äù of the outbreak.
French broadcaster BFM TV identified the man as Amirouche Hammar, a resident of Bobigny, a northeastern suburb of Paris. In an interview with the station, Hammar said when he fell ill last year with a dry cough, fatigue and a fever, he thought he had flu. Doctors at the time could not diagnose him.
‚ÄúI was surprised,‚Äù he said, about being told much later by doctors that he had been suffering from COVID-19. He is fully recovered. He said he had not travelled abroad for months before falling ill, and did not know where he could have been infected.
His wife said she works at a retailer near a Paris airport, and frequently comes into contact with travellers from overseas.
Independent experts said the findings of the French scientists needed more investigation.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not impossible that it was an early introduction, but the evidence isn‚Äôt conclusive by any means,‚Äù said Jonathan Ball, a professor of molecular virology at Britain‚Äôs University of Nottingham.
Stephen Griffin, an expert at the University of Leeds‚Äô Institute of Medical Research, said it was ‚Äúa potentially important finding‚Äù and added: ‚ÄúWe must be cautious when interpreting these findings.‚Äù
Cohen told French television on Monday it was too early to know if the patient, whose last trip abroad, to Algeria, had been in August 2019, was France‚Äôs ‚Äúpatient zero‚Äù.
But ‚Äúidentifying the first infected patient is of great epidemiological interest as it changes dramatically our knowledge regarding SARS-COV-2 (the new coronavirus) and its spreading in the country,‚Äù he and his co-researchers wrote in the paper detailing their findings.
They said the absence of a link with China and the lack of recent travel ‚Äúsuggest that the disease was already spreading among the French population at the end of December 2019‚Äù.
France, where almost 25,000 people have died from COVID-19 since March 1, confirmed its first three cases on Jan. 24, including two patients in Paris and another in the southwestern city of Bordeaux.
Rowland Kao, a professor of veterinary epidemiology and data science at Edinburgh University, said that even if it were confirmed, the identification of a positive COVID-19 in December ‚Äúis not necessarily an indication that the spread of COVID-19 from France started this early‚Äù.
‚ÄúIf confirmed, what this case does highlight is the speed at which an infection starting in a seemingly remote part of the world can quickly seed infections elsewhere,‚Äù he said.","['Kate Kelland', 'Min Read']",2020-05-05 15:54:34

Speaking to French media, Agnes Buzyn said one case of the virus had been confirmed in Bordeaux while the second had been found near Paris - marking the first confirmed cases of the novel virus in Europe.
Shortly afterwards a third case, believed to be a family member of one of those to have already been announced, was confirmed in the country.

Mr Varadkar issued the warning after French authorities earlier this week revealed that a man had been infected with Covid-19 as far back as 27 December.
Referencing this, the Irish leader said: ‚ÄúIn some ways this is not surprising, France is well connected to China with dozens of flights every day ‚Äì and Ireland is well connected to France.

‚ÄúIndeed, it is very possible that this virus was already in Ireland last year or January this year and we should not assume it came here from Italy in late February just because the first confirmed case did so.‚Äù
Mr Varadkar promised that further research and retrospective testing will be carried out to ‚Äúgive us a better idea‚Äù of Ireland‚Äôs earliest cases, adding that ‚Äútime will tell‚Äù.
He also rejected criticism that Ireland, having lowered the rate of Covid-19 transmission thanks to its lockdown measures, has been slow to return to normality compared to other countries.
‚ÄúIt is true we are slower than countries, much less affected than us like Australia, New Zealand, and slower than countries much worse affected than us, like Spain and Belgium,‚Äù he said on Thursday from the Dail, Ireland‚Äôs principal assembly chamber.
He added, ‚Äúthis is a decision the government made‚Äù and ‚Äúit‚Äôs one we stand over‚Äù.
This comes as an Irish medical expert warned that it was not enough to flatten the country‚Äôs curve as authorities attempt to contain the deadly virus.
Professor of general practice Liam Glynn told Newstalk FM that Ireland should not be satisfied with only lowering the level of transmission.
‚ÄúWe have come a long way in terms of the flattening the curve, and all the signals in terms of hospitalisations and intensive care admissions all seem to be dropping,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThe question now is where we are going?

‚ÄúIt is not just enough to flatten the curve, in my view, I think we really need to be talking about crushing this curve and trying to eliminate Covid-19 entirely.‚Äù
Prof Glynn said Ireland has an advantage in combating the virus, as it is an island.
‚ÄúWe have the advantage of trying to figure out how we do trade and travel across a border, and how we do it safely. If we go for elimination, the only way the virus can get on to this island is by importation.‚Äù‚Äã
Mr Varadkar has meanwhile said that the country‚Äôs pandemic payments, which are supporting workers and business affected by the crisis, will continue beyond mid-June but warned they cannot last forever.

It comes after it was revealed that Frenchman Amirouche Hammar, 43, had been infected with COVID-19 outside Paris as early as December.
The hospital where Hammar was treated for chest pains has since re-tested samples and found the fishmonger was positive for the virus on December 27. It is not known where he caught the virus, although his wife works close to Charles de Gaulle airport.
A number of French athletes who were at the World Military Games from October 18 to 27 have since described coming down with severe flu-like symptoms while at the event.
Elodie Clouvel, a world champion modern pentathlete, was asked on March 25 whether she was anxious about spending the summer in Japan for the Olympics. She told Loire 7: 'No because I think that with Velentin (Belaud, her partner, also a pentathlete) we have already had the coronavirus, well the COVID-19.'

Amirouche Hammar (pictured) has revealed himself as the French patient who had coronavirus as early as December 27
Elodie Clouvel told French media she wasn't concerned about competing at the Olympics in Japan because she'd already had the virus
The 31-year-old went on: 'We were in Wuhan for the World Military Games at the end of October. And afterwards, we all fell ill. Valentin missed three days of training. Me, I was sick too. [...] I had things I had never had before. We weren't particularly worried because no one was talking about it yet.'
French 'patient zero' had COVID-19 in December Amirouche Hammar came forward after a hospital near Paris revealed it had re-tested old flu samples and found a positive test for coronavirus on December 27. The Algerian-born fish market worker had not travelled to China, and the result suggests the virus was spreading in France well before January 24 when the country confirmed its first case. Speaking to BFMTV, Hammar said he had suffered 'very serious' chest pains but said doctors had been mystified by his illness before eventually diagnosing a lung infection. Although experts have urged caution about the findings, the WHO said today it was 'not surprising' that a case had occurred in December and said that more such discoveries were possible. 'It's also possible there are more early cases to be found,' WHO spokesman Christian Lindmeier told a UN briefing in Geneva. Hammar's wife works at a supermarket near Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris where passengers are known to go shopping after they land. The doctor who revealed the case said the patient's wife had worked at a fish market with Chinese colleagues.
She added: 'A lot of athletes at the World Military Games were very ill. We were recently in touch with a military doctor who told us: ""I think you had it because a lot of people from this delegation were ill.""'
The French delegation were competing in the 7th World Military Games in Wuhan - just 20 days before the first Chinese person officially became ill with coronavirus - with 402 athletes present, along with 10,000 other athletes from all over the world.
According to French news channel BFMTV, a number of athletes returned to France with unusual symptoms, including fevers and body aches.
According to the news channel, none of the returning athletes was tested and the French Army who were responsible for organising their athletes at the military games reportedly confirmed that they had not wanted to test any athletes either.
Doctors have speculated that the virus might have been making its way around before even December, in November or even in October, and the latest revelations seem to underscore that.
BFMTV quotes one athlete, who preferred to remain anonymous, as saying that he originally thought he had simply caught a cold.
However, when news began to emerge of an epidemic in Wuhan, many athletes on a WhatsApp group reportedly began to openly wonder if it was possible that they had contracted the disease too.
Now that it has been revealed that Amirouche Hammar in France had the coronavirus back in December, closer attention is being paid to what these athletes have said.

Clouvel told French media in March: 'A lot of athletes at the World Military Games were very ill. We were recently in touch with a military doctor who told us: ""I think you had it because a lot of people from this delegation were ill.""'
Local media report that since she spoke up on March 25, many athletes have been asked not to answer questions from journalists and to refer media enquiries to the head of communication of the French armies.
According to French media, athletes who were in Wuhan reportedly received telephone calls from the army a few weeks ago to reassure them.
One of these athletes, who also preferred to remain anonymous, is quoted as saying: 'We were told: there is no risk, you left on 28th October and the virus arrived on 1st November.'
French media report that sick athletes were also noted in some other delegations, including the Swedish delegation, with people returning to Sweden with strong fevers.
Around 100 people from the Swedish Armed Forces attended the World Military Games in Wuhan and stayed in the city for two weeks.
Several competitors fell ill and were screened for the virus, although none were reported to have tested positive.
It comes after Sweden's government epidemiologist Anders Tegnell said it was 'very natural' to assume that coronvirus was spreading in Scandinavia from November.
Tegnell told Sweden's TT news agency: 'There wasn't any spread [of infection] outside Wuhan until we saw it in Europe later.
State epidemiologist Anders Tegnell (pictured above) claimed individual cases would have been detected among travellers from Wuhan
'But I think that you could find individual cases among Wuhan travellers who were there in November to December last year. That doesn't sound at all strange, but rather very natural.'
Sweden - one of just a handful of countries to resist a lockdown - has no plans to implement large-scale sample testing of patients who received care for respiratory symptoms or flu last year to see if they had coronavirus.
The country's first official coronavirus case was a woman in J√∂nk√∂ping who tested positive on January 31st after a trip to China. The woman has since recovered from the illness.","['Ross Ibbetson', 'Ross Ibbetson For Mailonline']",2020-05-06 09:06:16

Chinese netizens and experts urge the US authority to release health and infection information of the US military delegation which came to Wuhan for the Military World Games in October to end the conjecture about US military personnel bringing COVID-19 to China.An American journalist claimed one US military athlete in the delegation could be patient zero of the deadly new disease.George Webb, an investigative journalist in Washington, DC claimed in recent videos and tweets that he believes Maatje Benassi, an armed diplomatic driver and cyclist who was in Wuhan in October for the cycling competition in the Military World Games, could be patient zero of COVID-19 in Wuhan.In a report by the US Department of Defense official website on October 25, Maatje Benassi has participated 50-mile cycling road race in Wuhan.Webb also quoted a military lab, the Fort Detrick laboratory that handles high-level disease-causing organisms such as Ebola, in Fredrick, Maryland, which was shut down and moved in July due to unqualified facilities and management system.His conclusions, although without strong evidence, triggered questions on Chinese social media as it came only days after a petition was submitted to the White House website on March 10 listing some coincidences in time between the Fort Detrick lab's closure and the COVID-19 outbreak.Many Chinese netizens have urged the US to test Benassi for COVID-19 and release information on the US delegation.Li Haidong, a professor of US studies at the China Foreign Affairs University in Beijing, told the Global Times on Tuesday that the US government needs to respond to the controversy and publish the relevant information regarding their health status and infection record to clear public doubts and help with the scientific study on the virus' origin.US politicians have been contending the novel coronavirus is ""Made in China,"" while global scientists, including those in the US, have not found strong evidence to prove the virus' origin.Given this situation, it is important to trace any suspicious points, the US delegation to the Wuhan games in this scenario, and find out what really happened, Li said.COVID-19, a deadly disease caused by the novel coronavirus, has infected more than 330,000 people around the world and killed more than 14,000.Identifying the origin will help develop effective therapy on the disease. The US should provide information of the delegation members to support related research, Li said.Earlier in March, Zhao Lijian, an outspoken Chinese diplomat, raised a suspicion on his personal Twitter account that it might have been the US army representatives to the Military World Games who brought the novel coronavirus to Wuhan in October 2019, after a top US health official admitted detecting coronavirus infections on some deceased flu patients. Zhao urged the US to disclose further information, exercise transparency on coronavirus cases and provide an explanation to the public.",['Global Times'],

New evidence suggests that the coronavirus was spreading around the globe as early as December.
In Florida, at least 170 COVID-19 patients reported symptoms from December 31 to February 29, according to the Miami Herald.
In France, a man arrived at a hospital outside Paris coughing up blood in late December. His sample later tested positive for the coronavirus.

New evidence from Florida and France suggests that the coronavirus had already spread out of Wuhan, China, and begun traveling across the globe as early as December.
The findings come as researchers test samples from patients with respiratory illnesses who went to hospitals in December, January, and February. The results suggest the virus could have begun spreading through communities outside China weeks earlier than previously realized.
""It's really important that we look further into this,"" Maria Van Kerkhove, the World Health Organization's COVID-19 technical lead, said in a press briefing on Wednesday. ""Some countries may look backwards and may look at some of those samples that were stored in January or in December and may retest those. So it's possible that we may see some of those samples testing positive for COVID-19.""

A new genetic analysis lends further credence to an earlier timeline of spread. The study, from scientists at University College London's Genetics Institute, found that most of the virus's genetic mutations (which so far don't have known effects on symptoms or contagiousness) exist in all the hardest-hit countries. This suggests worldwide spread likely began ""from extremely early on in the pandemic,"" the researchers wrote. Their work was published Tuesday in the journal Infection, Genetics and Evolution.
Andrew Brouwer, an assistant research scientist at the University of Michigan, told Business Insider that identifying early patients in each country or state helps epidemiologists ""reconstruct the history of the outbreak.""

""By the time we detect a severe case, there is already local transmission,"" Brouwer said.

Florida officials documented that at least 170 confirmed COVID-19 patients reported symptoms between December 31 and February 29, the Miami Herald reported on Tuesday, based on an analysis of data from the Florida Department of Health. The state didn't officially confirm its first COVID-19 cases until March 1.
According to the Herald, most of those people had not traveled and 40% had no reported contact with a known coronavirus patient.
Florida health department spokesperson Alberto Moscoso told the Herald that many COVID-19 patients ""reported symptoms that started weeks before their confirmatory tests.""
However, he said, ""it cannot be determined definitively if these early symptoms were a result of COVID-19 or other causes.""
Still, the new data suggests the virus was spreading through Florida by January, and possibly as early as late December.

California, too, is trying to identify its earliest coronavirus patients. On April 23, Gov. Gavin Newsom asked coroners and medical examiners to review the state's deaths as far back as December.
The decision came after new autopsy results showed that COVID-19 killed two people in Santa Clara County on February 6 and 17, weeks earlier than the deaths previously considered the state's earliest.
""When this occurred is important forensic information, profoundly significant in understanding the epidemiology of this disease, all of those things are brought to bear with more clarity and light,"" Newsom told reporters when he ordered the autopsies. ""Not only because of this specific announcement, but I imagine subsequent announcements that may be made by similar efforts all across the state of California.""
In cities across the country, the virus may have already taken hold by February.
A model from researchers at Northeastern University suggests that the coronavirus had started spreading in New York, San Francisco, Chicago, Boston, and Seattle by early February. Thousands of people were probably unknowingly contracting the disease, The New York Times reported.

Cohen heads the intensive-care unit at the Avicenne and Jean-Verdier hospital outside of Paris, where a 42-year-old man arrived coughing up blood on December 27, 2019. That was four days before China first informed the World Health Organization of its new pneumonia outbreak.
The man tested negative for flu, but his respiratory sample later tested positive for COVID-19, according to an analysis Cohen co-authored, which is set to be published in the International Journal of Microbial Agents.

Last Friday, I was reading Thierry Malleret‚Äôs excellent Monthly Barometer weekly picks and his summary of Aaron Timm‚Äôs ‚ÄòBeyond the growth gospel‚Äô piece about the de-growth movement caught my attention.
After reading the piece, I was interested to find out more about this movement. For me ‚Äògetting knowledgeable‚Äô is both knowing the key people involved (to build my learning network on the topic) as well as get the seminal or most relevant articles/conversations on the topic. I will outline below the process I follow, heavily influenced by my academic days.
Is the author on Twitter?
Twitter is a very paradoxical place. On one hand it gets easily demeaned as a trashy place where the signal-to-noise ratio is so low that it‚Äôs hardly worth spending any time there, to it being regularly featured as a Top 10 learning tools in many enterprise learning software rankings. The reality is both are true, and if you‚Äôre in the latter camp you‚Äôre likely a ‚ÄòTwitter nerd‚Äô as one 150,000 strong community manager in the cybersecurity space labelled himself recently. And being a ‚ÄòTwitter nerd‚Äô requires a lot of upfront investment to build your learning network in the topics which matter to you and most people who discover Twitter nowadays don‚Äôt see the rationale for spending the time to extract an uncertain or distantly visible value (more for them at the end of the article).
Fortunately, Aaron Timms is on Twitter ‚Äî most journalists are, and he tweeted the article he wrote on de-growth:
And when a tweet is there, it‚Äôs likely that the people interested or quoted in the article are also there commenting on it. And surely enough Giorgos Kallis (ecological economist at the Autonomous University of Barcelona) replied to the tweet:
I now had identified 3 people which could be relevant to learning more about the de-growth movement.
2. Is the author a leading voice in a particular topic?
The next stage for me was to identify whether there is a community around the de-growth movement or whether it is part of a larger community.
I therefore searched both Aaron Timms and Giorgos Kallis in RightRelevance (which is now part of Cronycle).
Aaron Timms RighRelevance profile is as follows:
Aaron Timms profile in RightRelevance
Giorgos Kallis RightRelevance profile is as follows:
Giorgos Kalis profile in RightRelevance
You can see in these profiles the Topics in which RightRelevance has ranked both Aaron and Giorgos as leading voices or opinion leaders (labelled as ‚ÄòInfluencers‚Äô in the platform). In the case of Giorgos there are two topics which appear to be related to Degrowth: ‚ÄòEcological Economics‚Äô and ‚ÄòNew Economy Movement‚Äô
3. Building a feed of relevant articles on Degrowth
I then move to Cronycle ( a freemium platform) where I will create a feed specifically on degrowth.
a) Creating a feed
Whilst Cronycle was originally a RSS and Twitter aggregator, its acquisition of RightRelevance allowed it to include proprietary Topics as sources to create a feed. Topics allow user to get relevant articles filtered both by the semantics and the leading voices of that specific topic. Cronycle has always strived to give transparency to its users about this filtering and all the ‚Äòinfluencer‚Äô members of a topic is visible and searchable in the platform. Similarly, some of the alternate semantic forms of the topic are also displayed.
You can view the community for ‚ÄòEcological Economics‚Äô as a topic here: link
Ecological economics topic view in Cronycle
You can see from this view that i) Giorgos is actually ranked as the top ‚Äòinfluencer‚Äô in Ecological Economics (total of 36 members); ii) the influencer list includes both individuals as well as organisations and iii) a list of related topics to Ecological Economics is displayed on the right hand panel.
You can create a feed for this chosen topic from the Discovery view above or alternatively from the Feed tab on Cronycle (see below a sequence of screens showing how to create a feed aggregating Ecological Economics and New Economy Movement as topical sources):
Feed view in Cronycle
Create view in Cronycle
Aggregating ‚ÄòNew Economy Movement‚Äô topic with the ‚ÄòEcological Economics‚Äô one
The next step would then be to filter within this article corpus for only articles which include ‚Äòdegrowth‚Äô as a keyword.
b) Filtering with a keyword
As ‚ÄòDegrowth‚Äô is not (yet) a topic in its own right, I can use the keyword filter functionality for the feed to only surface articles within these two aggregated topics which include ‚Äòdegrowth‚Äô as a keyword (see below).
Filtering my feed with the keyword ‚Äòdegrowth‚Äô
You could also use the advanced mode if you wanted to use a boolean-based filter.
4) Refining your learning network and articles
I now have createsd a high quality feed on ‚Äòdegrowth‚Äô in a few steps which allows me to become more knowledgeable in this area on an on-going basis.
I have made this feed available here publicly: open-access degrowth feed
In the case of the degrowth movement, Jason Hickel had been referenced or appeared in a number of articles in the feed but was not an influencer in either the Ecological Economics or New Economy Movement topics. I subsequently added him as a single handle in the feed (by opening the feed setting and adding him as a single Twitter handle source).
As I discover more experts in this field in my feed or as new leading voices are added to the dynamic Cronycle list of influencers, I will also access their public resources/webpage. For example both Jason and Giorgos have good websites linked herein",['Nicolas Granatino'],2020-02-06 18:54:55

SARS-CoV-2 in pets
Pets in homes with owners with COVID-19
On April 22, the CDC announced the first National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL)-confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in two pet cats. These are the first pets in the United States to test positive for SARS-CoV-2. Currently we have no information that suggests that pets might be a source of infection for people with the coronavirus that causes COVID-19.
To date, globally, the only pets incidentally exposed to COVID-19 that have tested positive, with confirmation, for SARS-CoV-2 are two pet dogs and a pet cat in Hong Kong, and two pet cats in the United States. The two pet cats in the United States both had signs of mild respiratory illness and are expected to make a full recovery. The pet cat in Hong Kong did not exhibit clinical signs of disease. Another pet cat in Belgium tested positive, but details around that case are less clear. The dogs and cats in Hong Kong were each in the care of and had close contact with a person who had been confirmed to have COVID-19. In the case of the cat in Belgium, other diseases and conditions that could have caused those same signs of illness were not ruled out and there are also questions about how samples demonstrating the presence of SARS-CoV-2 were collected and evaluated. That cat recovered.
Until more is known about this virus, if you are ill with COVID-19 you should restrict contact with pets and other animals, just as you would restrict your contact with other people. When possible, have another member of your household or business care for any animals, including pets while you are sick. If you have a service animal or you must care for your animals, including pets, wear a cloth face covering; don‚Äôt pet, share food, kiss, or hug them; and wash your hands before and after any contact with your pet, service animal, or other animals. You should not share dishes, drinking glasses, cups, eating utensils, towels, or bedding with other people or pets in your home.
Additional guidance on managing pets in homes where people are sick with COVID-19 is available from the CDC.
Keeping pets safe
For responsible pet owners, preparing in advance is key. Make sure you have an emergency kit prepared, with at least two weeks‚Äô worth of your pet‚Äôs food and any needed medications. Usually we think about emergency kits like this in terms of what might be needed for an evacuation, but it‚Äôs also good to have one prepared in the case of quarantine or self-isolation when you cannot leave your home.
Other appropriate practices include not letting pets interact with people or other animals outside the household; keeping cats indoors, if possible, to prevent them from interacting with other animals or people; walking dogs on a leash, maintaining at least 6 feet from other people and animals; and avoiding dog parks or public places where a large number of people and dogs gather.
If you are ill with COVID-19 (either suspected or confirmed with a test), restrict contact with your pets and other animals, just like you would with other people; have another member of your household care for your pets while you are sick; avoid contact with your pet, including petting, snuggling, being kissed or licked, and sharing food or bedding. If you must care for your pet or be around animals while you are sick, wear a cloth face covering and wash your hands before and after you interact with them.
While we are recommending these as good practices, it is important to remember that there is currently no reason at this time to think that domestic animals, including pets, in the United States might be a source of infection with SARS-CoV-2. Accordingly, there is no reason to remove pets from homes where COVID-19 has been identified in members of the household, unless there is risk that the pet itself is not able to be cared for appropriately. In this emergency, pets and people each need the support of the other and veterinarians are there to support the good health of both.
Dogs and cats in Hong Kong
At the onset of the COVID-19 outbreak in Hong Kong, government officials with the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) recommended that mammalian pets, including dogs and cats, from households with persons hospitalized because of COVID-19 should be cared for in quarantine and tested for infection with SARS-CoV-2. As of April 15, 30 dogs, 17 cats, and 2 hamsters have been held at the AFCD quarantine facility. However, only two dogs and one cat have tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. None of the animals in quarantine, including the three positive animals, developed clinical signs of respiratory disease, and at least six animals have been released from quarantine, including both dogs that tested positive. Additional details on the positive animals are provided below. The World Organisation for Animal Health indicates that, ‚Äúinfection of animals with COVID-19 virus meets the criteria of an emerging disease. Therefore, any infection of animals with the COVID-19 virus . . . should be reported to the OIE in accordance with the Terrestrial Animal Health Code.‚Äù The Hong Kong government has reported all positive animals to the OIE.
On Thursday, February 27, Hong Kong‚Äôs Agriculture, Fisheries, and Conservation Department (AFCD) reported that samples obtained on February 26 from the nasal and oral cavities of a quarantined 17-year-old Pomeranian whose owner had been diagnosed with COVID-19 had tested ‚Äúweak positive‚Äù for SARS-CoV-2, using a real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test. Results from a rectal swab and fecal sample were negative. The RT-PCR test is sensitive, specific, and does not cross-react with other coronaviruses of dogs or cats. A ‚Äúweak positive‚Äù result suggests a small quantity of SARS-CoV-2 RNA was present in the samples, but does not distinguish between RNA detected from intact virus and that detected from fragments of viral RNA.
PCR testing was repeated on samples collected February 28, March 2, 5, and 9 with continued ‚Äúweak positive‚Äù results on nasal cavity samples. In addition, gene sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 from the Pomeranian and its close human contacts was completed on March 12 and the viral sequences were very similar. Results of a virus neutralizing antibody test on a sample collected March 3 were negative, but further serological testing on that blood sample yielded positive results, suggesting that the Pomeranian had developed an immune response to the virus. Virus isolation was performed with negative results. Results of RT PCR conducted on nasal samples on March 12 and 13 were also negative, and the dog was released to its owner on the following day. The dog never showed clinical signs of respiratory disease during quarantine.
Experts from the School of Public Health of the University of Hong Kong and the College of Veterinary Medicine and Life Sciences of the City University of Hong Kong believe the consistency and persistence of the results suggest the virus may have spread from the infected people to the Pomeranian in this particular case. Testing was conducted by the laboratories of the AFCD and the School of Public Health of the University of Hong Kong. The latter is an accredited reference laboratory for the WHO for the testing of SARS-COV-2.
Unfortunately, the Pomeranian that tested positive reportedly passed away three days after release. The dog was 17 years old and had ongoing health issues that were likely responsible for the death of this dog, rather than COVID-19.
On March 18, the AFCD reported that a two-year-old German Shepherd Dog, whose owner had tested positive for COVID-19, had also tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, using RT-PCR. The dog also had positive results of tests run on samples collected March 19 and 20, and then negative results for 10 consecutive days.
On March 25, the AFCD reported that virus was isolated from one or more samples collected from the German Shepherd Dog, and on April 3, reported that the dog developed neutralizing antibodies to the virus. Another mixed-breed dog from the same residence continually tested negative for SARS-CoV-2. Neither dog developed signs of respiratory disease while in quarantine, and both were returned to their owner.
On March 30, the AFCD reported that a pet cat that lived in a residence with an individual confirmed to be ill with COVID-19 had tested positive, using RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 via oral cavity, nasal, and rectal swab samples. Results of testing of oral and nasal swab samples collected on April 1 were also positive. The cat is in quarantine and has exhibited no clinical signs of disease.
Cat in Belgium
During the third week of March, the Federal Agency for the Safety of the Food Chain (FASFC) in Belgium reported it was informed on March 18 by the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine at the University of Liege that viral RNA of SARS-CoV-2 was detected by PCR (RRT-PCR and high throughput sequencing PCR; specifics not provided) in the feces and vomit of a cat with digestive and respiratory clinical signs. The cat was owned by a person infected with SARS-CoV-2, but according to the Scientific Committee of the FASFC it is not known whether the sequences of virus in the cat and the owner were similar.
Information is not available regarding what other conditions potentially leading to respiratory or gastrointestinal signs were considered or evaluated for this cat. The cat reportedly became ill one week after its owner had returned from Italy, but the date samples were collected in relationship to when the cat‚Äôs clinical signs first appeared and how those samples were collected (e.g., directly from the cat, off the floor) are also not known. Because other etiologic causes for the cat‚Äôs illness appear to have not been excluded and little is known about the samples in which viral material was detected, a clear link between the presence of viral material and clinical signs consistent with coronavirus infection cannot be established. The condition of the cat reportedly improved 9 days after onset of clinical signs.
Cats in New York, United States
On April 22, the CDC and the US National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL) announced the first confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in two pet cats. The cats lived in two separate areas of New York state. Both had mild respiratory illness and are expected to make a full recovery.
A veterinarian tested the first cat after it showed mild respiratory signs. No individuals in the household had been confirmed to be ill with COVID-19. The virus may have been transmitted to the cat by mildly ill or asymptomatic household members or through contact with an infected person outside its home.
Samples from the second cat were taken after it showed clinical signs of respiratory illness. The owner of that cat tested positive for COVID-19 prior to the cat showing clinical signs. Another cat in the household has exhibited no clinical signs of illness.
Both cats tested presumptive positive for SARS-CoV-2 at a private veterinary laboratory, which then reported the results to state and federal officials. Confirmatory testing was conducted at the NVSL and included collection of additional samples. These NVSL-confirmed results will be reported to the OIE.
Results of commercial laboratories‚Äô testing of samples from companion animals
As of April 17, two commercial laboratories in the United States reported they had tested (RT-PCR) thousands of specimens from dogs and cats for SARS-CoV-2 and had obtained no positive results. These specimens have come from the United States, South Korea, Canada, and Europe, including regions concurrently experiencing human COVID-19 cases. While this is encouraging, the specimens tested were originally submitted for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis of more common pathogens causing respiratory disease in dogs and cats and, as such, per-case information as to whether or not these dogs and cats had contact with confirmed COVID-19 positive people is not available.

SARS-CoV-2 in other species
Tiger in Bronx zoo, New York, United States
On April 5, the USDA National Veterinary Services Laboratories announced a positive finding of SARS-CoV-2 in samples from one tiger at the Bronx Zoo in New York City. This appears to be the first instance of a tiger being infected with COVID-19.
On April 3, quantitative PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 on duplicate respiratory tract samples from a four-year-old female Malayan tiger with abnormal respiratory signs that was living at the Wildlife Conservation Society‚Äôs (WCS) Bronx Zoo in New York was performed at the New York State Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory unit of the Animal Health Diagnostic Center at Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine and the University of Illinois College of Veterinary Medicine Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory. Presumptive positive results of that testing were confirmed by the USDA National Veterinary Services Laboratory on April 4.
The tiger was one of two Malayan tigers, two Amur tigers, and three African lions that developed respiratory signs over the course of a week; respiratory signs included a dry cough and, in some cases, wheezing, but no dyspnea or nasal or ocular discharge. Mild anorexia was also noted in some animals. On April 22, it was reported that fecal samples obtained from the other animals exhibiting clinical signs had also tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. All of the large cats are long-term residents of the zoo, do not have chronic medical conditions, and there have been no new animals introduced to the groups for several years. All other Amur and Malayan tigers, a snow leopard, cheetah, clouded leopard, Amur leopard, puma (Puma concolor), and serval at the zoo still appear healthy.
The source of infection was presumed to be transmission from a zookeeper, who at the time of exposure had not yet developed symptoms of COVID-19. The zoo has been closed to the public since mid-March, and the first tiger began showing signs of being ill on March 27. All of these large cats are recovering well. Other animals in other parts of the zoo have shown no clinical signs of disease. Enhanced biosecurity protocols have been implemented for staff caring for all nondomestic felids in the four zoos overseen by the WCS.
Positive results have been reported to the OIE.
From the scientific literature
Since the genome of the new SARS-CoV-2 was first sequenced in January 2020, many research studies have been completed by scientists around the world to better understand the virus‚Äôs origin, modes of transmission, and pathogenic mechanisms. Some studies are designed to find good animal models of SARS-CoV-2 infection, whereas others are being conducted to explore the potential host range of the virus. Similar studies were conducted after the SARS outbreak in 2003-2004. Those earlier studies of a different, but related, coronavirus led to findings that civet cats (a species distinct from domestic cats) may have been an intermediate host for the SARS-CoV virus; domestic cats and ferrets could be experimentally infected with the SARS-CoV virus and transmit it to na√Øve cats or ferrets, respectively, under experimental conditions; and a very few cats (< 10) and one dog belonging to owners with SARS that lived in a large apartment complex in Hong Kong with an extremely high number of human SARS cases tested positive for the SARS-CoV virus.
Results of more recent studies describing experimental infections of domestic animals with SARS-CoV-2 or exploring the potential host range of SARS-CoV-2 can also help veterinarians and other public health professionals better understand what role, if any, animals might play in the ongoing pandemic. Several articles are summarized below. Ferrets, Syrian hamsters, and cats‚Äîall animals that may be kept as pets‚Äîshow early potential for serving as animal models of human infection, but dogs, pigs, chickens, and ducks do not. And, while molecular modeling and in vitro studies suggest that multiple animal species may theoretically be able to be infected with SARS-CoV-2, a definitive intermediate host has not yet been found. In addition, it is important to note that there is little to no evidence that domestic animals are easily infected with SARS-CoV-2 under natural conditions and no evidence that they can transmit the virus to people. The primary mode of transmission of COVID-19 in humans is person-to-person via respiratory droplets and contact.
A preprint of a research article posted online on March 30 at bioRxiv and subsequently published as a peer-reviewed research report in Science on April 8, together with initial results of studies conducted at the Friedrich Loeffler Institute (FLI) posted April 2 have raised public concern that cats and ferrets might be able to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 and transmit the virus to other animals. . We emphasize caution in not overinterpreting the results described in these and other articles, and also caution about extrapolating them to the potential for SARS-CoV-2 to naturally infect or be transmitted by companion animals kept as pets. Our rationale is as follows:
Experimentally induced infection does not mirror naturally induced infection. Just because an animal can be experimentally infected via direct intranasal or intratracheal inoculation of high concentrations of purified tissue-cultured virus does not mean that it will be easily be infected with that same virus under natural conditions.
The numbers of animals used in these experiments were small and the conclusions drawn are based on data points that were in some cases collected from as few as two animals.
Transmission studies described in the recent Science article were conducted by placing one experimentally infected cat in a negatively pressurized isolator cage with a double-layer net divider separating it from its uninfected counterpart. In each isolator, HEPA-filtered air flow was directed from the inoculated to the na√Øve cat with a HEPA-filtered airflow outlet preventing recirculation of infectious virus particles. Only two of six uninfected cats in the 2020 study became infected via transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from experimentally infected cats. Results from so few animals in ideal conditions for viral transmission should not be used as conclusive evidence that infected cats can readily transmit COVID-19, particularly under natural conditions.
Initial results reported by the FLI suggest pigs and chickens cannot be infected with SARS-CoV-2, but ferrets, which are a good model for other human respiratory infections, may also prove to be a good animal model of infection with the virus. Further studies are ongoing and their results will need to be assessed before more definitive statements can be made.
Ferrets are often used as an animal model of human respiratory infections, including those caused by the influenza virus, and two additional studies provide support to the studies described above that ferrets may also serve as a good animal model of SARS-CoV-2 infection in people. The first of these was published online in Cell Host & Microbe on April 6, and the second was posted as a preprint on April 17 at bioRxiv. A disclaimer on the bioRxiv website notes papers posted there ‚Äúshould not be regarded as conclusive, guide clinical practice/health-related behavior, or be reported in news media as established information.‚Äù Nonetheless, in both the preprint and peer-reviewed article, ferrets were readily infected with SARS-CoV-2 following intranasal inoculation with a high dose of tissue-cultured virus, and inoculated ferrets transmitted virus to na√Øve ferrets either placed in the same cage (direct contact) or an adjacent cage that shared airflow. Infection was detected via RT-PCR (viral RNA), virus isolation, and serology (neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2). In one study, virus was detected via immunohistochemistry in tissue specimens collected following euthanasia of several of the ferrets. Although infected ferrets in one study developed abnormal clinical signs (transient fever and cough), infected animals in the other study remained clinically normal. While results of these studies, which are still based on relatively small numbers of animals, do provide additional evidence that ferrets can be experimentally infected with SARS-CoV-2 and transmit the virus to na√Øve ferrets, there is no evidence to suggest that ferrets play a role in transmitting COVID-19 to humans.
Evidence from a peer-reviewed study published March 26, 2020 in Clinical Infectious Diseases suggests that Syrian hamsters may also serve as an animal model of human COVID-19. In this study, researchers first used molecular modeling to demonstrate the theoretical affinity of the receptor binding domain (RBD) on the SARS-CoV-2 surface spike protein for angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) on the surface of Syrian hamster cells. Binding of the virus via its spike protein to ACE2 on the surface of host cells is one of the necessary steps for replication and amplification of SARS-CoV-2 in permissive hosts. Young (6-10 weeks old) Syrian hamsters were then experimentally infected via intranasal inoculation with a high dose of tissue-cultured SARS-CoV-2 and used to study the time course of infection as well as transmission of virus from infected to na√Øve hamsters. On days 2, 4, 7, and 14 post inoculation in the time course of infection study or days 4 and 14 post inoculation or exposure in the transmission study, a subset of hamsters in each group were euthanized, and various respiratory and non-respiratory tissue specimens were assessed via quantitative RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry for presence of SARS-CoV-2; via quantitative RT-PCR for cytokine/chemokine profiles in lung tissue (time course of infection study only); and via histopathology for pathological changes induced by the virus. In addition, in the time course of infection study, serology was conducted to determine whether experimentally infected hamsters developed virus neutralizing antibodies. Although the overall number of hamsters assessed at each time-point post inoculation or exposure was relatively small (n = 5 or n = 3), results were consistent among all animals at each time point, suggesting that Syrian hamsters can be experimentally infected with SARS-CoV-2, with mild to moderate disease developing that is similar to that found in humans with respect to duration of clinical signs and subsequent recovery; virus localization, pathological lesions and cytokine profiles in respiratory tissues; and neutralizing antibodies produced. In addition, experimentally infected Syrian hamsters effectively transmitted SARS-CoV-2 to na√Øve animals via direct contact, and those infected na√Øve animals also developed mild to moderate disease that is similar to that in the inoculated animals. While this article does provide initial evidence that suggests Syrian hamsters may be another good animal model for human COVID-19, it also provides no evidence to suggest that hamsters play any role in transmitting the disease to humans.
A number of preprints recently posted online to the bioRxiv site have used molecular modeling and in vitro studies to assess binding properties between the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) found on the surface of a variety of cells in numerous animal species. In humans, ACE2 is used by SARS-CoV-2 as a necessary receptor to gain entry into host cells. Although the protein sequence and structure of ACE2 is fairly conserved across animal species, changes in one or more amino acids, particularly in the viral binding region of ACE2, can decrease binding affinity between the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and the host cell. Results of these recent studies have been used to predict the host range of SARS-CoV-2 as a means to ultimately help identify one or more intermediate hosts for this virus. Potential domestic animal hosts for SARS-CoV-2 based on two such preprints posted recently on bioRxiv include camels, cattle, horses, goats, sheep, pigs, cats, and rabbits (preprint posted April 11); and Chinese hamsters, cats, cattle, sheep, and goats (preprint posted April 18). We must emphasize that although binding of SARS-CoV-2 to ACE2 on host cells may be necessary for the virus to infect a given species, it is not sufficient for infection. There are numerous other virus-host interactions that are required for SARS-CoV-2 to enter and replicate within that host cell while evading the host immune system in order to amplify and spread as infectious viral particles to other members of the same host species. Thus, although results of molecular modeling and in vitro studies such as those described here may provide clues that can help identify permissive hosts for SARS-CoV-2, they should not be used to make definitive statements regarding the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to infect or be transmitted by a given animal species under natural‚Äîor even experimental‚Äîconditions.
Molecular modeling can also be used to help understand evolutionary pathways of viruses resulting in changes in virulence and host tropism. A peer-reviewed study published in Molecular Biology and Evolution on April 14 that used such modeling to consider the origin of SARS-CoV-2 concluded that dogs may have served as an intermediate host in the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 from bats to humans. The author bases this conclusion on the use of Data Analysis for Molecular Biology and Evolution (DAMBE) software to calculate the conventional index of CpG deficiency (I CpG ) of beta- and alphacoronavirus sequences to assess the evolutionary pressure of host zinc finger antiviral protein (ZAP) on these viruses. Because ZAP binds to CpG dinucleotides in viral RNA genomes, which results in inhibition of viral replication and mediation of viral genome degradation, viruses that infect host tissues with high concentrations of ZAP face evolutionary pressure resulting in genetic point mutations that downregulate the expression of genomic CpG dinucleotides. This allows the virus to evade the antiviral effects of host ZAP. The conventional index of CpG deficiency (I CpG ) can be used to determine whether a virus has downregulated CpG expression, and if so, to what extent. Viruses with an index < 1 are considered CpG deficient, and the lower the index, the greater the extent of downregulation. Although the author presents an interesting theory to explain his conclusion that the dog serves as an intermediate host for SARS-CoV-2 infection of humans, it is just that, an interesting theory. No evidence other than I CpG values and tissue tropism of various alpha- and betacoronaviruses was presented to indicate either that SARS-CoV-2 evolved from a canine alphacoronavirus or that dogs played any role in infection of people with SARS-CoV-2. In fact, the SARS-CoV-2 genome and protein sequences are not at all similar to those of canine alpha- or betacoronaviruses. And, to date, studies attempting to experimentally infect dogs with SARS-CoV-2 have not met with much success.
Other studies to investigate what role, if any, companion animals might play in the current COVID-19 pandemic have asked whether cats and dogs living in areas with a high number of human COVID-19 cases could be exposed to and become infected with SARS-CoV-2.
A preprint, posted on April 3 at bioRxiv, described one such study during the initial outbreak of COVID-19 in Wuhan, China. Again, a disclaimer on the bioRxiv website notes papers posted there ‚Äúshould not be regarded as conclusive, guide clinical practice/health-related behavior, or be reported in news media as established information.‚Äù
Blood was collected from 39 cats prior to the onset of the outbreak (March-May 2019) and 102 cats after the onset (January-March 2020) and sera stored before testing.
Antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were not detected in any samples collected prior to the outbreak, suggesting that virus was not circulating in Wuhan prior to the onset of the outbreak
After the outbreak, SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies were detected in 15 of 102 serum samples obtained from cats (14.7%). These 15 cats either lived with an owner who had COVID-19 (n=3), at a veterinary clinic (n=6), or on the street as strays until they were moved to an animal shelter after the onset of the outbreak (n=7).
It was not reported how many of the 87 cats that were seronegative for SARS-CoV-2 lived with people who had COVID-19.
Eleven of the ELISA-positive samples were also positive via a tissue culture-based virus neutralizing test (VNT). The highest titers of neutralizing antibodies (1:360 or 1:1080) were found in samples from the three cats that lived with owners who had COVID-19; four cats did not have detectable neutralizing antibodies, and all other titers were < 1:40.
The results of serology from more than 100 cats in Wuhan during the peak of the outbreak provide initial evidence that cats can be exposed to the virus, likely by infected people, and mount an antibody response.
However, the relatively low seroconversion rate and low to non-existent titers of virus neutralizing antibodies in all but the three cats who lived with people diagnosed with COVID-19 suggests that cats may not be readily infected with SARS-CoV-2 under natural conditions.
The significance of this seroconversion rate to development of virus-mediated disease in cats or transmission of the virus from cats to other animals, including people, is not known.
A second preprint, posted on April 9 at bioRxiv, reported on 21 pets (12 dogs and 9 cats) living in close contact with their owners in a community of 20 French veterinary students. Two of the students had tested positive for COVID-19 and 11 others developed symptoms consistent with COVID-19 infection. Although a few pets developed clinical signs that could have been consistent with a coronavirus infection, none of the animals tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR and no antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 were detectable in serum using an immunoprecipitation assay.
Nothing in any of the research preprints or articles described here provides conclusive evidence that, under natural conitions, cats, ferrets, Syrian hamsters or other domestic animals can be readily infected with or transmit SARS-CoV-2. However, many additional studies are underway to better understand the transmission dynamics and pathogenic mechanisms of this virus, with results of multiple studies being posted or published online on an almost daily basis. To help veterinarians and other animal health professionals stay current with what is known about SARS-CoV-2 and domestic animals, an online rapid review of the literature has been conducted by the Systematic Reviews for Animals & Food organization. This rapid review was first posted on March 20, 2020 and has been updated multiple times since. The AVMA updates our COVID-19 webcenter on a regular basis to help ensure veterinarians have the best data available upon which to base clinical decisions and risk assessments, so we encourage you to check back often.
Summary and current recommendations
Despite the number of global cases of COVID-19 surpassing the 2.6 million mark as of April 22, 2020, we are aware of only three pets (two dogs and one cat) in Hong Kong, and a tiger and two pet cats in New York state, that have tested positive, with confirmation, for SARS-CoV-2. Of the pets confirmed to be positive, only two (the cats in New York state) exhibited signs of illness consistent with infection with SARS-CoV-2. Both of the ill cats showed mild signs of illness and are expected to fully recover. No conclusions can responsibly be drawn regarding the cat in Belgium because of questions surrounding collection and analysis of samples for testing for SARS-CoV-2 and the absence of an evaluation of that cat for other, more common causes for its clinical signs. The tiger was said to be exposed via contact with a zoo employee who was actively shedding virus, and some other large cats at the zoo that were apparently housed in proximity did exhibit signs of respiratory disease, but are expected recovering. At this point in time, there is also no evidence that domestic animals, including pets and livestock, can spread COVID-19 to people.
Therefore, the AVMA maintains its current recommendations regarding SARS-CoV-2 and animals. These recommendations, which are supported by guidance from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and World Organization for Animal Health (OIE), are that:
Animal owners without symptoms of COVID-19 should continue to practice good hygiene during interactions with animals. This includes washing hands before and after such interactions and when handling animal food, waste, or supplies.
Do not let pets interact with people or other animals outside the household.
Keep cats indoors, when possible, to prevent them from interacting with other animals or people.
Walk dogs on a leash, maintaining at least 6 feet from other people and animals. Avoid dog parks or public places where a large number of people and dogs gather.
Until more is known about the virus, those ill with COVID-19 should restrict contact with pets and other animals, just as you would restrict your contact with other people. Have another member of your household or business take care of feeding and otherwise caring for any animals, including pets. If you have a service animal or you must care for your animals, including pets, then wear a cloth face covering; don‚Äôt share food, kiss, or hug them, and wash your hands before and after any contact with them.
At this point in time, there is no evidence to suggest that domestic animals, including pets and livestock, that may be incidentally infected by humans play a role in the spread of COVID-19.
Routine testing of animals for SARS-CoV-2 is NOT recommended. Veterinarians are strongly encouraged to rule out other, more common causes of illness in animals before considering testing for SARS-CoV-2 (see additional information under ‚ÄúTesting Animals for SARS-CoV-2‚Äù).
Human outbreaks are driven by person-to-person transmission. Accordingly, we see no reason to remove pets from homes even if COVID-19 has been identified in members of the household, unless there is risk that the pet itself is not able to be cared for appropriately.
During this pandemic emergency, animals and people each need the support of the other and veterinarians are there to support the good health of both.",[],2020-03-13 00:00:00

European Union officials have unveiled their ‚Äúroadmap‚Äù to phase out the ongoing coronavirus containment measures. But they warned of a ‚Äúvery long‚Äù exit from a crisis that has been a devastating double whammy to the continent‚Äôs health and economic wellbeing.
The European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, warned that a failure by countries to work together on their exit strategies could lead to a dangerous second wave of covid-19. ‚ÄúIf shops are open on one side of the border, we don‚Äôt want people moving from one member state to the next to use the shopping opportunity,‚Äù she said, urging authorities in EU member states not to erase the progress made from the painful lockdowns imposed over the past month.
Over 80 000 people have died in Europe from covid-19, about two thirds of the global death toll, but some EU countries have already started easing their lockdowns by allowing some school classes and businesses to reopen. Von der Leyen said that EU countries should use a ‚Äúgradual, tailormade approach‚Äù to lifting lockdown restrictions.
‚ÄúThe way back to normality will be very long,‚Äù the commission‚Äôs roadmap says, warning that masks, gloves, tests, and applications to track people‚Äôs movements will become routine‚Äîand that a full economic recovery will probably have to wait until a vaccine is found.
Testing capability Stella Kyriakides, commissioner for health and food safety, said, ‚ÄúUntil effective treatments and a vaccine are found, we will have to learn to live with this virus. But Europe will be back on its feet, together and united. This is the only way.‚Äù For relaxation of the lockdown, the European roadmap recommends: Epidemiological criteria showing that the spread of the disease has significantly decreased and stabilised for a sustained period;
Sufficient health system capacity, such as taking into account the occupation rate for intensive care units, the availability of healthcare workers, and medical material; and
Appropriate monitoring capacity, including large scale testing capacity to quickly detect and isolate infected people, as well as tracking and tracing capacity. Von der Leyen has also announced a ‚Äúvirtual pledging conference‚Äù on 4 May for governments, institutions, and private entities to raise money for vaccine research. John McCauley, director of the Crick Worldwide Influenza Centre in London, told The BMJ that much of the UK‚Äôs ability to successfully come out of the lockdown and follow the EU‚Äôs easing of restrictions would depend on its testing capability. He noted the lack of a very reliable and widely available antibody test to facilitate easing restrictions. ‚ÄúThis question [of testing capability] applies to Europe, as well,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIf we have to rely on RNA tests, how are we going to prioritise testing, given that it will have to be done repeatedly?‚Äù Ahead of the UK government‚Äôs announcement on 16 April that the current lockdown would continue for at least three more weeks, Neil Ferguson, Imperial College epidemiologist and government adviser, said that social distancing would probably need to continue for another 18 months‚Äînamely, until a vaccine became available. But many commentators have said that regulations will need to be nuanced. Robert Dingwall, a professor of sociology at Nottingham Trent University, said that the UK government would need to consider the disproportionate burden the lockdown had placed on poorer Britons. ‚ÄúThere has been a lack of awareness among our policy and scientific elite on how policy has been made by people with gardens for those without gardens,‚Äù he said. The UK‚Äôs strategy for exiting the lockdown On 17 April the business secretary, Alok Sharma, outlined the five tests that would need to be satisfied before the government considered relaxing current social distancing measures: Ensure that the NHS can cope and can provide sufficient critical care and specialist treatment across the UK. See a sustained and consistent fall in the daily number of covid-19 deaths, to be confident that the UK has moved beyond the peak. Have reliable data from the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies showing that the rate of infection is decreasing to manageable levels. Be confident that the range of operational challenges, including testing capacity and personal protective equipment, are in hand, with the supply able to meet future demand. Be confident that any adjustments to the current measures will not risk a second peak of infections that overwhelms the NHS. Sharma said, ‚ÄúThe worst thing we could do now is ease up too soon and allow a second peak of the virus to hit the NHS and hit the British people. ‚ÄúNow is not the time to let up. The risk still persists‚Äînot only for yourself, but for the people around you. So we must stay vigilant.‚Äù",['Michael Day'],2020-05-13 00:00:00

Coordination between countries is crucial
Europe has been hit especially hard by the covid-19 pandemic, with Italy, Spain, and France occupying the top three positions in the global league table of deaths.1 All EU countries have imposed measures to contain the spread of the virus, although these vary considerably. Now, as some countries see death rates falling, they are looking at how to get back to something resembling normality, and the European Commission has published a roadmap to guide them.2 Reassuringly, the roadmap places epidemiology in the driving seat.
Key elements The roadmap has three key elements. First, no country should consider lifting restrictions until it is certain that the disease is under control. This will pose a challenge for some, as it presupposes that national authorities have accurate and timely information on cases and deaths. As the United Kingdom‚Äôs experience shows, this can be difficult. The importance of this information cannot be overstated. Measures taken must be judged against their ability to keep the reproduction number, or R 0 , below 1. In other words, each infected person should not infect more than one other. Second, countries should ensure that they have sufficient health system capacity, especially to provide intensive care, given the risk of a second wave of infections. Fortunately, there have been many examples of countries with spare capacity, such as Germany, offering care to patients from other countries that have been hit especially hard.3 Third, there must be sufficient capacity for large scale testing and monitoring, linked to the ability to track and trace contacts of those infected. This too will be challenging for some and will necessitate bringing additional laboratories on board. The roadmap emphasises the importance of coordination after the decision to lift restrictions has been made. This is especially important in border areas. In the twin towns of Nova Gorica and Gorizia, for example, the Italian-Slovenian border divides the main square, and it would be bizarre to have different policies on either side. Although not stated in the commission‚Äôs document, the special status of Northern Ireland after Brexit will require similar measures across the Irish border. So, the European Commission has called on governments to notify their neighbours, and the EU, when they propose loosening controls. What the roadmap does not do is prescribe what measures should be taken. These are the responsibility of national governments. It does, however, emphasise that whatever decisions are taken should be accompanied by a robust system of reporting and contact tracing, expanded testing capacity, strengthened health systems that are adequate to cope with any resurgence of infection after restrictions are lifted, improved personal protection, and progress in developing new treatments. All of these measures should be harmonised, making it possible to exchange information. Ultimately, however, the European Commission recognises that the threat will be lifted only when there is a safe and effective vaccine.
Principles The roadmap proposes principles to underpin any loosening. First, change should be gradual, allowing enough time to determine any impact. Second, general measures should be replaced with progressively more specific ones; for example, continuing to protect vulnerable people for longer. Third, when border controls are lifted, there should be careful coordination, paying particular attention to the situation facing those who live in border areas. Fourth, economic activity should be phased in; for example, by allowing those who can work at home to continue to do so for longer. Fifth, the risks of transmission in different gatherings, such as sports activities, cafes, or schools, should be considered carefully. Sixth, measures such as enhanced hygiene and social distancing should continue. Lastly, again, there should be careful monitoring. Finally, the roadmap looks to the future. In his speech to the French people on 13 April, President Macron said: ‚ÄúIn this crisis there is a chance . . . to build another project.‚Äù4 This vision is echoed in the call to revitalise the economy, returning to a path of sustainable growth and a greener society, supported by a major recovery programme, accompanied by a package of measures including research on vaccines and treatments and international cooperation. The initial European response to covid-19 was fragmented and poorly coordinated. The European Commission‚Äôs president, who trained as a public health physician, has said that Europe owes Italy an apology for failing to respond adequately.5 But the commission‚Äôs powers are limited. Covid-19 is a reminder that there is little point adopting national measures against a virus that crosses borders with ease. A stronger Europe, with enhanced powers in health, will be an essential barricade against the next pandemic.6 The recovery will take a very long time, but at least the roadmap provides a way forward. The UK is, of course, now outside the EU and initially declined an invitation to join the joint procurement initiative.7 At some stage it will have to develop its own roadmap. Neil Ferguson, epidemiologist and professor of mathematical biology who advises the British government, has said that there is ‚Äúlittle leeway‚Äù to relax measures without ‚Äúsomething . . . in their place,‚Äù such as testing and contact tracing.8 Given the limited progress so far, this seems a long way off. When the plan finally emerges, it will very likely look much like what the EU has produced already. We can only hope that it avoids what has become the norm over the past four years, whereby the EU publishes detailed proposals while the corresponding British documents, lacking substance, have to be prised from the hands of ministers. Maybe, given the urgency involved, this time we could borrow some ideas from our neighbours.

Harvard Says 2022,"LISTEN TO ARTICLE 2:18 SHARE THIS ARTICLE Share Tweet Post Email
People around the world might need to practice some level of social distancing intermittently through 2022 to stop Covid-19 from surging anew and overwhelming hospital systems, a group of Harvard disease researchers said Tuesday.
Lifting social-distancing measures all at once could risk simply delaying the epidemic‚Äôs peak and potentially making it more severe, the scientists warned in an article published Tuesday in the journal Science.
The course of the pandemic will depend on questions not yet answered: Will the virus‚Äôs spread change with the seasons? What immunity will people have after they‚Äôre infected? And does exposure to coronaviruses that cause mild illnesses confer any protection against the pathogen that causes Covid-19?
Those questions are being weighed by government leaders who have seen economies around the globe come to a standstill because of the social-distancing measures. With millions of people out of work and staying home, pressure is growing to loosen restrictions in the U.S. and elsewhere. Doing so, experts have said, will depend on having in place measures to control the disease, such as widespread testing.
The Harvard researchers used computer models to simulate how the pandemic might play out. One possibility is that strict social distancing followed by intensive public-health detective work could chase down and eradicate the virus. That‚Äôs what happened with SARS-CoV-1, which caused a 2003 outbreak. But with confirmed cases of the new pathogen approaching 2 million globally, that outcome is seen as increasingly unlikely, the researchers wrote.
Seasonal Illness
More likely is that the virus is here to stay like influenza, traveling the globe seasonally. In one model, 20 weeks of measures to limit spread were followed by an epidemic peak that was as great as an uncontrolled spread.
‚ÄúThe social distancing was so effective that virtually no population immunity was built,‚Äù the researchers said of that scenario. If the virus is more transmissible in colder months, delaying the peak into the autumn could exacerbate the strain on health-care systems, they wrote.
To avoid such outcomes, on-and-off social distancing measures might be needed until 2022, unless hospital capacity is increased, or effective vaccines or treatments are developed.
The authors don‚Äôt endorse a particular path forward but said they sought ‚Äúto identify likely trajectories of the epidemic under alternative approaches.‚Äù",['John Tozzi'],2020-04-14 16:01:26
205,eb2d9be6-ae48-4fea-be3a-a10f23575f4e,eduardo.garcia,https://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2020/04/14/science.abb5793,Projecting the transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 through the postpandemic period,"Abstract It is urgent to understand the future of severe acute respiratory syndrome‚Äìcoronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) transmission. We used estimates of seasonality, immunity, and cross-immunity for betacoronaviruses OC43 and HKU1 from time series data from the USA to inform a model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. We projected that recurrent wintertime outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2 will probably occur after the initial, most severe pandemic wave. Absent other interventions, a key metric for the success of social distancing is whether critical care capacities are exceeded. To avoid this, prolonged or intermittent social distancing may be necessary into 2022. Additional interventions, including expanded critical care capacity and an effective therapeutic, would improve the success of intermittent distancing and hasten the acquisition of herd immunity. Longitudinal serological studies are urgently needed to determine the extent and duration of immunity to SARS-CoV-2. Even in the event of apparent elimination, SARS-CoV-2 surveillance should be maintained since a resurgence in contagion could be possible as late as 2024.
The ongoing severe acute respiratory syndrome‚Äìcoronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has caused nearly 500,000 detected cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) illness and claimed over 20,000 lives worldwide as of 26 Mar 2020 (1). Experience from China, Italy, and the United States demonstrates that COVID-19 can overwhelm even the healthcare capacities of well-resourced nations (2‚Äì4). With no pharmaceutical treatments available, interventions have focused on contact tracing, quarantine, and social distancing. The required intensity, duration, and urgency of these responses will depend both on how the initial pandemic wave unfolds and on the subsequent transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2. During the initial pandemic wave, many countries have adopted social distancing measures, and some, like China, are gradually lifting them after achieving adequate control of transmission. However, to mitigate the possibility of resurgences of infection, prolonged or intermittent periods of social distancing may be required. After the initial pandemic wave, SARS-CoV-2 might follow its closest genetic relative, SARS-CoV-1, and be eradicated by intensive public health measures after causing a brief but intense epidemic (5). Increasingly, public health authorities consider this scenario unlikely (6). Alternatively, the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 could resemble that of pandemic influenza by circulating seasonally after causing an initial global wave of infection (7). Such a scenario could reflect the previous emergence of known human coronaviruses from zoonotic origins e.g. human coronavirus (HCoV) OC43 (8). Distinguishing between these scenarios is key for formulating an effective, sustained public health response to SARS-CoV-2.
The pandemic and post-pandemic transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 will depend on factors including the degree of seasonal variation in transmission, the duration of immunity, and the degree of cross-immunity between SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses, as well as the intensity and timing of control measures. SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the betacoronavirus genus, which includes the SARS-CoV-1 coronavirus, MERS coronavirus, and two other human coronaviruses, HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1. The SARS-CoV-1 and MERS coronaviruses cause severe illness with approximate case fatality rates of 9 and 36% respectively, but the transmission of both has remained limited (9). HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 infections may be asymptomatic or associated with mild to moderate upper respiratory tract illness; these HCoVs are considered the second most common cause of the common cold (9). HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 cause annual wintertime outbreaks of respiratory illness in temperate regions (10, 11), suggesting that wintertime climate and host behaviors may facilitate transmission, as is true for influenza (12‚Äì14). Immunity to HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 appears to wane appreciably within one year (15), while SARS-CoV-1 infection can induce longer-lasting immunity (16). The betacoronaviruses can induce immune responses against one another: SARS-CoV-1 infection can generate neutralizing antibodies against HCoV-OC43 (16) and HCoV-OC43 infection can generate cross-reactive antibodies against SARS-CoV-1 (17). While investigations into the spectrum of illness caused by SARS-CoV-2 are ongoing, recent evidence indicates the majority of cases experience mild to moderate illness with more limited occurrence of severe lower respiratory infection (18). Current COVID-19 case fatality rates are estimated to lie between 0.6% and 3.5% (19, 20), suggesting lower severity than SARS-CoV-1 and MERS but higher severity than HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1. The high infectiousness near the start of often mild symptoms makes SARS-CoV-2 considerably harder to control with case-based interventions such as intensive testing, isolation and tracing, compared to SARS-CoV-1 and MERS coronaviruses (21).
Intensive testing and case-based interventions have so far formed the centerpiece of control efforts in some places, such as Singapore and Hong Kong (22). Many other countries are adopting measures termed ‚Äúsocial distancing‚Äù or ‚Äúphysical distancing,‚Äù closing schools and workplaces and limiting the sizes of gatherings. The goal of these strategies is to reduce the peak intensity of the epidemic (‚Äúflatten the curve‚Äù) (22), reducing the risk of overwhelming health systems and buying time to develop treatments and vaccines. For social distancing to have reversed the epidemic in China, the effective reproduction number must have declined by at least 50-60%, assuming a baseline R 0 between 2 and 2.5 (22). Through intensive control measures, Shenzhen was able to reduce the effective reproduction number by an estimated 85% (23). However, it is unclear how well these declines in R 0 might generalize to other settings: recent data from Seattle suggests that the basic reproduction number has only declined to about 1.4, or by about 30-45% assuming a baseline R 0 between 2 and 2.5 (24). Furthermore, social distancing measures may need to last for months to effectively control transmission and mitigate the possibility of resurgence (25).
A key metric for the success of social distancing interventions is whether critical care capacities are exceeded. Modeling studies (26) and experience from the Wuhan outbreak (2) indicate that critical care capacities even in high-income countries can be exceeded many times over if distancing measures are not implemented quickly or strongly enough. To alleviate these problems, approaches to increase critical care capacity have included rapid construction or repurposing of hospital facilities and consideration of increased manufacturing and distribution of ventilators (27‚Äì30). Treatments that reduce the proportion of infections that lead to severe illness could have a similar effect of reducing burden on healthcare systems.
This paper identifies viral, environmental, and immunologic factors which in combination will determine the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2. We integrate our findings in a mathematical model to project potential scenarios for SARS-CoV-2 transmission through the pandemic and post-pandemic periods and identify key data still needed to determine which scenarios are likely to play out. Then, using the model, we assess the duration and intensity of social distancing measures that might be needed to maintain control of SARS-CoV-2 in the coming months under both existing and expanded critical care capacities.
Transmission dynamics of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 We used data from the United States to model betacoronavirus transmission in temperate regions and to project the possible dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 infection through the year 2025. We first assessed the role of seasonal variation, duration of immunity, and cross immunity on the transmissibility of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 in the US. We used the weekly percentage of positive laboratory tests for HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 (31) multiplied by the weekly population-weighted proportion of physician visits due to influenza-like illness (ILI) (32, 33) to approximate historical betacoronavirus incidence in the US to within a scaling constant. This proxy is proportional to incidence under a set of assumptions described in the supplementary materials and methods. To quantify variation in transmission strength over time, we estimated the weekly effective reproduction number, defined as the average number of secondary infections caused by a single infected individual (34, 35). The effective reproduction numbers for each of the betacoronaviruses displayed a seasonal pattern, with annual peaks in the effective reproduction number slightly preceding those of the incidence curves (fig. S1). We limited our analysis to ‚Äúin-season‚Äù estimates based on adequate samples, defined as week 40 through week 20 of the following year, roughly October to May. For both HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1, the effective reproduction number typically reached its peak between October and November and its trough between February and May. Over the five seasons included in our data (2014-2019), the median peak effective reproduction number was 1.85 (range: 1.61-2.21) for HCoV-HKU1 and 1.56 (range: 1.54-1.80) for HCoV-OC43 after removing outliers (five for HCoV-HKU1, zero for HCoV-OC43). Results were similar using various choices of incidence proxy and serial interval distributions (figs. S1 to S3). To quantify the relative contribution of immunity versus seasonal forcing on the transmission dynamics of the betacoronaviruses, we adapted a regression model (36) that expressed the effective reproduction number for each strain (HKU1 and OC43) as the product of a baseline transmissibility constant (related to the basic reproduction number (R 0 ) and the proportion of the population susceptible at the start of each season), the depletion of susceptibles due to infection with the same strain, the depletion of susceptibles due to infection with the other strain, and a spline to capture further unexplained seasonal variation in transmission strength (seasonal forcing). These covariates were able to explain most of the observed variability in the effective reproduction numbers (adjusted R2: 74.3%). The estimated multiplicative effects of each of these covariates on the weekly reproduction number are depicted in Fig. 1. As expected, depletion of susceptibles for each strain was negatively correlated with transmissibility of that strain. Depletion of susceptibles for each strain was also negatively correlated with the reproduction number of the other betacoronavirus strain, providing evidence of cross-immunity. Per incidence proxy unit, the effect of the cross-immunizing strain was always less than the effect of the strain itself (table S1), but the overall impact of cross-immunity on the reproduction number could still be substantial if the cross-immunizing strain had a large outbreak (e.g., HCoV-OC43 in 2014-15 and 2016-17). The ratio of cross-immunization to self-immunization effects was larger for HCoV-HKU1 than for HCoV-OC43, suggesting that HCoV-OC43 confers stronger cross-immunity. Seasonal forcing appears to drive the rise in transmissibility at the start of the season (late October through early December), while depletion of susceptibles plays a comparatively larger role in the decline in transmissibility toward the end of the season. The strain-season coefficients were fairly consistent across seasons for each strain and lacked a clear correlation with incidence in prior seasons, consistent with experimental results showing substantial waning of immunity within a year (15). Fig. 1 Effects of depletion of susceptibles and seasonality on the effective reproduction number by strain and season. Estimated multiplicative effects of HCoV-HKU1 incidence (red), HCoV-OC43 incidence (blue), and seasonal forcing (gold) on weekly effective reproduction numbers of HCoV-HKU1 (top panels) and HCoV-OC43 (bottom), with 95% confidence intervals. The black dot (with 95% confidence interval) plotted at the start of each season is the estimated coefficient for that strain and season compared to the 2014-15 HCoV-HKU1 season. The seasonal forcing spline is set to 1 at the first week of the season (no intercept). On the x-axis, the first ‚Äúweek in season‚Äù corresponds to epidemiological week 40. We integrated these findings into a two-strain ordinary differential equation (ODE) susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered-susceptible (SEIRS) compartmental model to describe the transmission dynamics of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 (fig. S4). The model provided a good fit to both the weekly incidence proxies for HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 and to the estimated weekly effective reproduction numbers (Fig. 2). According to the best-fit model parameters, the R 0 for HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 varies between 1.7 in the summer and 2.2 in the winter and peaks in the 2nd week of January, consistent with the seasonal spline estimated from the data. Also in agreement with the findings of the regression model, the duration of immunity for both strains in the best-fit SEIRS model is about 45 weeks, and each strain induces cross-immunity against the other, though the cross-immunity that HCoV-OC43 infection induces against HCoV-HKU1 is stronger than the reverse. Fig. 2 Transmission model fits for HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1. (A) Weekly percent positive laboratory tests multiplied by percent influenza-like illness (ILI) for the human betacoronaviruses HCoV-OC43 (blue) and HCoV-HKU1 (red) in the United States between 5 July 2014 and 29 June 2019 (solid lines) with simulated output from the best-fit SEIRS transmission model (dashed lines). (B and C) Weekly effective reproduction numbers (R e ) estimated using the Wallinga-Teunis method (points) and simulated R e from the best-fit SEIRS transmission model (line) for HCoVs OC43 and HKU1. The opacity of each point is determined by the relative percent ILI multiplied by percent positive laboratory tests in that week relative to the maximum percent ILI multiplied by percent positive laboratory tests for that strain across the study period, which reflects uncertainty in the R e estimate; estimates are more certain (darker points) in weeks with higher incidence.
Simulating the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 Next, we incorporated a third betacoronavirus into the dynamic transmission model to represent SARS-CoV-2. We assumed a latent period of 4.6 days (26, 37‚Äì39) and an infectious period of 5 days, informed by the best-fit values for the other betacoronaviruses (table S8). We allowed the cross immunities, duration of immunity, maximum R 0 , and degree of seasonal variation in R 0 to vary. We assumed an establishment time of sustained transmission on 11 March 2020, when the World Health Organization declared the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak a pandemic (40) and we varied the establishment time in a sensitivity analysis (fig. S7). For a representative set of parameter values, we measured annual SARS-CoV-2 infections (tables S2 to S4 and fig. S7) and the peak annual SARS-CoV-2 prevalence (tables S5 to S7 and fig. S7) through 2025. We summarized the post-pandemic SARS-CoV-2 dynamics into the categories of annual outbreaks, biennial outbreaks, sporadic outbreaks, or virtual elimination (tables S2 to S7). Overall, shorter durations of immunity and smaller degrees of cross-immunity from the other betacoronaviruses were associated with greater total incidence of infection due to SARS-CoV-2, and autumn establishments and smaller seasonal fluctuations in transmissibility were associated with larger pandemic peak sizes. Model simulations demonstrated the following key points. SARS-CoV-2 can proliferate at any time of year In all modeled scenarios, SARS-CoV-2 was capable of producing a substantial outbreak regardless of establishment time. Winter/spring establishments favored outbreaks with lower peaks, while autumn/winter establishments led to more acute outbreaks (tables S2 to S4 and fig. S7). The five-year cumulative incidence proxies were comparable for all establishment times (tables S2 to S4). If immunity to SARS-CoV-2 is not permanent, it will likely enter into regular circulation Much like pandemic influenza, many scenarios lead to SARS-CoV-2 entering into long-term circulation alongside the other human betacoronaviruses (e.g., Fig. 3, A and B), possibly in annual, biennial, or sporadic patterns over the next five years (tables S2 to S4). Short-term immunity (on the order of 40 weeks, similar to HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1) favors the establishment of annual SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks, while longer-term immunity (two years) favors biennial outbreaks. Fig. 3 Invasion scenarios for SARS-CoV-2 in temperate regions. These plots depict the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 (black, cases per 1,000 people), HCoV-OC43 (blue, % positive multiplied by % ILI), and HCoV-HKU1 (red, % positive multiplied by % ILI) for a representative set of possible pandemic and post-pandemic scenarios. The scenarios were obtained by varying the cross immunity between SARS-CoV-2 and HCoVs OC43/HKU1 (œá 3X ) and vice-versa (œá X3 ), the duration of SARS-CoV-2 immunity (1/œÉ 3 ), and the seasonal variation in R 0 (f), assuming an epidemic establishment time of 11 March 2020 (depicted as a vertical grey bar). Parameter values used to generate each plot are listed below; all other parameters were held at the values listed in table S8. (A) A short duration (1/œÉ 3 = 40 weeks) of SARS-CoV-2 immunity could yield annual SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks. (B) Longer-term SARS-CoV-2 immunity (1/œÉ 3 = 104 weeks) could yield biennial outbreaks, possibly with smaller outbreaks in the intervening years. (C) Higher seasonal variation in transmission (f = 0.4) would reduce the peak size of the invasion wave, but could lead to more severe wintertime outbreaks thereafter [compare with (B)]. (D) Long-term immunity (1/œÉ 3 = infinity) to SARS-CoV-2 could lead to elimination of the virus. (E) However, a resurgence of SARS-CoV-2 could occur as late as 2024 after a period of apparent elimination if the duration of immunity is intermediate (1/œÉ 3 = 104 weeks) and if HCoVs OC43/HKU1 impart intermediate cross immunity against SARS-CoV-2 (œá 3X = 0.3). (A) œá 3X = 0.3, œá X3 = 0, 1/œÉ 3 = 40 weeks, f = 0.2. (B) œá 3X = 0.7, œá X3 = 0, 1/œÉ 3 = 104 weeks, f = 0.2. (C) œá 3X = 0.7, œá X3 = 0, 1/œÉ 3 = 104 weeks, f = 0.4. (D) œá 3X = 0.7, œá X3 = 0, 1/œÉ 3 = infinity, f = 0.2. (E) œá 3X = 0.3, œá X3 = 0.3, 1/œÉ 3 = 104 weeks, f = 0.4. High seasonal variation in transmission leads to smaller peak incidence during the initial pandemic wave but larger recurrent wintertime outbreaks The amount of seasonal variation in SARS-CoV-2 transmission could differ between geographic locations, as for influenza (12). The R 0 for influenza in New York declines in the summer by about 40%, while in Florida the decline is closer to 20%, which aligns with the estimated decline in R 0 for HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 (table S8). A 40% summertime decline in R 0 would reduce the unmitigated peak incidence of the initial SARS-CoV-2 pandemic wave. However, stronger seasonal forcing leads to a greater accumulation of susceptible individuals during periods of low transmission in the summer, leading to recurrent outbreaks with higher peaks in the post-pandemic period (Fig. 3C). If immunity to SARS-CoV-2 is permanent, the virus could disappear for five or more years after causing a major outbreak Long-term immunity consistently led to effective elimination of SARS-CoV-2 and lower overall incidence of infection. If SARS-CoV-2 induces cross immunity against HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1, the incidence of all betacoronaviruses could decline and even virtually disappear (Fig. 3D). The virtual elimination of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 would be possible if SARS-CoV-2 induced 70% cross immunity against them, which is the same estimated level of cross-immunity that HCoV-OC43 induces against HCoV-HKU1. Low levels of cross immunity from the other betacoronaviruses against SARS-CoV-2 could make SARS-CoV-2 appear to die out, only to resurge after a few years Even if SARS-CoV-2 immunity only lasts for two years, mild (30%) cross-immunity from HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 could effectively eliminate the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 for up to three years before a resurgence in 2024, as long as SARS-CoV-2 does not fully die out (Fig. 3E). To illustrate these scenarios (Fig. 3), we used a maximum wintertime R 0 of 2.2, informed by the estimated R 0 for HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 (table S8). This is a low but plausible estimate of the basic reproduction number for SARS-CoV-2 (41). Increasing wintertime R 0 to 2.6 leads to more intense outbreaks, but the qualitative range of scenarios remains similar (fig. S8).
Assessing intervention scenarios during the initial pandemic wave Regardless of the post-pandemic transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2, urgent measures are required to address the ongoing epidemic. Pharmaceutical treatments and vaccines may require months to years to develop and test, leaving non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) as the only immediate means of curbing SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Social distancing measures have been adopted in many countries with widespread SARS-CoV-2 transmission. The necessary duration and intensity of these measures has yet to be characterized. To address this, we adapted the SEIRS transmission model (fig. S9) to capture moderate/mild/asymptomatic infections (95.6% of infections), infections that lead to hospitalization but not critical care (3.08% of infections), and infections that require critical care (1.32% of infections) (26). We assumed the worst-case scenario of no cross-immunity from HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 against SARS-CoV-2, which makes the SARS-CoV-2 model unaffected by the transmission dynamics of those viruses. Informed by the transmission model fits, we assumed a latent period of 4.6 days and an infectious period of 5 days, in agreement with estimates from other studies (26). The mean duration of non-critical hospital stay was 8 days for those not requiring critical care and 6 days for those requiring critical care, and the mean duration of critical care was 10 days (26). We varied the peak (wintertime) R 0 between 2.2 and 2.6 and allowed the summertime R 0 to vary between 60% (i.e. relatively strong seasonality) and 100% (i.e. no seasonality) of the wintertime R 0 , guided by the inferred seasonal forcing for HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 (table S8). We used the open critical care capacity of the United States, 0.89 free beds per 10,000 adults, as a benchmark for critical care demand (2). We simulated epidemic trajectories based on an epidemic establishment time of 11 March 2020. We simulated social distancing by reducing R 0 by a fixed proportion, which ranged between 0 and 60%. We assessed ‚Äòone-time‚Äô social distancing interventions, for which R 0 was reduced by up to 60% for a fixed duration of time (up to 20 weeks) or indefinitely starting two weeks after epidemic establishment. We also assessed intermittent social distancing measures, for which social distancing was turned ‚Äòon‚Äô when the prevalence of infection rose above a threshold and ‚Äòoff‚Äô when it fell below a second, lower threshold, with the goal of keeping the number of critical care patients below 0.89 per 10,000 adults. An ‚Äòon‚Äô threshold of 35 cases per 10,000 people achieved this goal in both the seasonal and non-seasonal cases with wintertime R 0 = 2.2. We chose 5 cases per 10,000 adults as the ‚Äòoff‚Äô threshold. These thresholds were chosen to qualitatively illustrate the intermittent intervention scenario; in practice, the thresholds will need to be tuned to local epidemic dynamics and hospital capacities. We performed a sensitivity analysis around these threshold values (figs. S10 and S11) to assess how they affected the duration and frequency of the interventions. We also implemented a model with extra compartments for the latent period, infectious period, and each hospitalization period so that the waiting times in these states were gamma-distributed instead of exponentially distributed (see the supplementary materials and methods and figs. S16 and S17). Finally, we assessed the impact of doubling critical care capacity (and the associated on/off thresholds) on the frequency and overall duration of the social distancing measures. We evaluated the impact of one-time social distancing efforts of varying effectiveness and duration on the peak and timing of the epidemic with and without seasonal forcing. When transmission was not subject to seasonal forcing, one-time social distancing measures reduced the epidemic peak size (Fig. 4 and fig. S12). Under all scenarios, there was a resurgence of infection when the simulated social distancing measures were lifted. However, longer and more stringent temporary social distancing did not always correlate with greater reductions in epidemic peak size. In the case of a 20-week period of social distancing with 60% reduction in R 0 , for example (Fig. 4D), the resurgence peak size was nearly the same as the peak size of the uncontrolled epidemic: the social distancing was so effective that virtually no population immunity was built. The greatest reductions in peak size come from social distancing intensity and duration that divide cases approximately equally between peaks (42). Fig. 4 One-time social distancing scenarios in the absence of seasonality. (A to E) Simulated prevalence of COVID-19 infections (solid) and critical COVID-19 cases (dashed) following establishment on 11 March 2020 with a period of social distancing (shaded blue region) instated two weeks later, with the duration of social distancing lasting (A) four weeks, (B) eight weeks, (C) twelve weeks, (D) twenty weeks, and (E) indefinitely. There is no seasonal forcing; R 0 was held constant at 2.2 (see fig. S12 for R 0 = 2.6). The effectiveness of social distancing varied from none to a 60% reduction in R 0 . Cumulative infection sizes are depicted beside each prevalence plot (F to J) with the herd immunity threshold (horizontal black bar). Of the temporary distancing scenarios, long-term (20-week), moderately effective (20%-40%) social distancing yields the smallest overall peak and total outbreak size. For simulations with seasonal forcing, the post-intervention resurgent peak could exceed the size of the unconstrained epidemic (Fig. 5 and fig. S13), both in terms of peak prevalence and in terms of total number infected. Strong social distancing maintained a high proportion of susceptible individuals in the population, leading to an intense epidemic when R 0 rises in the late autumn and winter. None of the one-time interventions was effective in maintaining the prevalence of critical cases below the critical care capacity. Fig. 5 One-time social distancing scenarios with seasonal transmission. (A to E) Simulated prevalence, assuming strong seasonal forcing (wintertime R 0 = 2.2, summertime R 0 = 1.3, or 40% decline), of COVID-19 infections (solid) and critical COVID-19 cases (dashed) following establishment on 11 March 2020 with a period of social distancing (shaded blue region) instated two weeks later, with the duration of social distancing lasting (A) four weeks, (B) eight weeks, (C) twelve weeks, (D) twenty weeks, and (E) indefinitely (see fig. S13 for a scenario with wintertime R 0 = 2.6). The effectiveness of social distancing varied from none to a 60% reduction in R 0 . Cumulative infection sizes are depicted beside each prevalence plot (F to J) with the herd immunity threshold (horizontal black bar). Preventing widespread infection during the summer can flatten and prolong the epidemic but can also lead to a high density of susceptible individuals who could become infected in an intense autumn wave. Intermittent social distancing could prevent critical care capacity from being exceeded (Fig. 6 and fig. S14). Due to the natural history of infection, there is an approximately 3-week lag between the start of social distancing and the peak critical care demand. When transmission is seasonally forced, summertime social distancing can be less frequent than when R 0 remains constant at its maximal wintertime value throughout the year. The length of time between distancing measures increases as the epidemic continues, as the accumulation of immunity in the population slows the resurgence of infection. Under current critical care capacities, however, the overall duration of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic could last into 2022, requiring social distancing measures to be in place between 25% (for wintertime R 0 = 2 and seasonality; fig. S11A) and 75% (for wintertime R 0 = 2.6 and no seasonality; fig. S9C) of that time. When the latent, infectious, and hospitalization periods are gamma-distributed, incidence rises more quickly, requiring a lower threshold for implementing distancing measures (25 cases per 10,000 individuals for R 0 = 2.2 in our model) and more frequent interventions (fig. S16). Fig. 6 Intermittent social distancing scenarios with current and expanded critical care capacity. SARS-Cov-2 prevalence (black curves) and critical cases (red curves) under intermittent social distancing (shaded blue regions) without seasonal forcing (A and C) and with seasonal forcing (B and D). Distancing yields a 60% reduction in R 0 . Critical care capacity is depicted by the solid horizontal black bars, and the on/off thresholds for social distancing are depicted by the dashed horizontal lines. (A) and (B) are the scenarios with current US critical care capacity and (C) and (D) are the scenarios with double the current critical care capacity. The maximal wintertime R 0 is 2.2 and for the seasonal scenarios the summertime R 0 is 1.3 (40% decline). Prevalence is in black and critical care cases are in red. To the right of each main plot (E to H), the proportion immune over time is depicted in green with the herd immunity threshold (horizontal black bar). Increasing critical care capacity allowed population immunity to be accumulated more rapidly, reducing the overall duration of the epidemic and the total length of social distancing measures (Fig. 6, C and D). While the frequency and duration of the social distancing measures was similar between the scenarios with current and expanded critical care capacity, the epidemic concluded by July 2022 and social distancing measures could be fully relaxed by early- to mid- 2021, depending again on the degree of seasonal forcing of transmission (Fig. 6, C and D). Introducing a hypothetical treatment that halved the proportion of infections that required hospitalization had a similar effect as doubling critical care capacity (fig. S15).
Discussion Here, we examined a range of likely SARS-CoV-2 transmission scenarios through 2025 and assessed non-pharmaceutical interventions that could mitigate the intensity of the current outbreak. If immunity to SARS-CoV-2 wanes in the same manner as related coronaviruses, recurrent wintertime outbreaks are likely to occur in coming years. The total incidence of SARS-CoV-2 through 2025 will depend crucially on this duration of immunity and, to a lesser degree, on the amount of cross immunity that exists between HCoVs OC43/HKU1 and SARS-CoV-2. The intensity of the initial pandemic wave will depend fundamentally on the basic reproduction number at the time of epidemic establishment: if establishment occurs in the autumn when the reproduction number is rising, which could occur in countries that maintain epidemic control by contact tracing and quarantine through the summer, or if SARS-CoV-2 is not subject to the same summertime decline in transmissibility as HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1, then a high peak prevalence of infection is likely. One-time social distancing efforts may push the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic peak into the autumn, potentially exacerbating the load on critical care resources if there is increased wintertime transmissibility. Intermittent social distancing might maintain critical care demand within current thresholds, but widespread surveillance will be required to time the distancing measures correctly and avoid overshooting critical care capacity. New therapeutics, vaccines, or other interventions such as aggressive contact tracing and quarantine ‚Äì impractical now in many places but more practical once case numbers have been reduced and testing scaled up (43) ‚Äì could alleviate the need for stringent social distancing to maintain control of the epidemic. In the absence of such interventions, surveillance and intermittent distancing (or sustained distancing if it is highly effective) may need to be maintained into 2022, which would present a substantial social and economic burden. To shorten the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic and ensure adequate care for the critically ill, increasing critical care capacity and developing additional interventions are urgent priorities. Meanwhile, serological testing is required to understand the extent and duration of immunity to SARS-CoV-2, which will help determine the post-pandemic dynamics of the virus. Sustained, widespread surveillance will be needed both in the short term to effectively implement intermittent social distancing measures and in the long term to assess the possibility of resurgences of SARS-CoV-2 infection, which could occur as late as 2025 even after a prolonged period of apparent elimination. Our observations are consistent with other predictions of how SARS-CoV-2 transmission might unfold and with assessments of the mitigation efforts that might be needed to curb the current outbreak. A modelling study using data from Sweden found that seasonal establishment of SARS-CoV-2 transmission is likely in the post-pandemic period (11). Observational and modelling studies (2, 26) that find that early implementation of strong social distancing is essential for controlling the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and that, in the absence of the development of new therapies or preventative measures, such as aggressive case finding and quarantining (21), intermittent distancing measures may be the only way to avoid overwhelming critical care capacity while building population immunity. The observation that strong, temporary social distancing can lead to especially large resurgences agrees with data from the 1918 influenza pandemic in the United States (44), in which the size of the autumn 1918 peak of infection was inversely associated with that of a subsequent winter peak after interventions were no longer in place. Our study was subject to a variety of limitations. Only five seasons of observational data on coronaviruses were available, though the incidence patterns resemble those from 10 years of data from a hospital in Sweden (11). We assumed that the spline coefficients were constant across all seasons though seasonal forcing likely differed from year to year based on underlying drivers. To keep the transmission model from becoming unreasonably complex, we assumed that there was no difference in the seasonal forcing, per-case force of infection, latent period, or infectious period across betacoronaviruses. However, our estimates for these values lie within the ranges of estimates from the literature. Although disease dynamics may differ by age, we did not have sufficient data to parameterize an age-structured model. We also did not directly model any effect from the opening of schools, which could lead to an additional boost in transmission strength in the early autumn (45). The transmission model is deterministic, so it cannot capture the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 extinction. It also does not incorporate geographic structure, so the possibility of spatially heterogeneous transmission cannot be assessed. The construction of spatially explicit models will become more feasible as more data on SARS-CoV-2 incidence becomes available; these will help determine whether there are differences in seasonal forcing between geographic locations, as for influenza (12), and will also help to assess the possibility of epidemic extinction while accounting for re-introductions. The timing and strength of post-pandemic outbreaks may also depend on stochastic introductions from abroad, which can be assessed using more complex, global models. We used percent test-positive multiplied by percent ILI to approximate coronavirus incidence up to a proportional constant; results were similar when using the raw number of positive tests and the raw percent positive as incidence proxies (fig. S1). While the percent test-positive multiplied by percent ILI has been shown to be one of the best available proxies for influenza incidence (32), the conversion between this measure and true incidence of coronavirus infections is unclear, and so we do not make precise estimates of the overall coronavirus incidence. This conversion will undoubtedly depend on the particular population for which these estimates are being made. In a recent study, an estimated 4% of individuals with coronavirus sought medical care, and only a fraction of these were tested (46). In addition, the method that we adopted to estimate the effective reproduction number depends on the serial interval distribution, which has not been well-studied for commonly circulating human coronaviruses; we used the best-available evidence from SARS-CoV-1, the most closely related coronavirus to SARS-CoV-2. Our findings generalize only to temperate regions, comprising 60% of the world‚Äôs population (47), and the size and intensity of outbreaks could be further modulated by differences in average interpersonal contact rates by location and the timing and effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical and pharmaceutical interventions. The transmission dynamics of respiratory illnesses in tropical regions can be much more complex. However, we expect that if post-pandemic transmission of SARS-CoV-2 does take hold in temperate regions, there will also be continued transmission in tropical regions seeded by the seasonal outbreaks to the north and south. With such reseeding, long-term disappearance of any strain becomes less likely (48), but according to our model the effective reproductive number of SARS-CoV-2 remains below 1 during most of each period when that strain disappears, meaning that reseeding would shorten these disappearances only modestly. Our findings indicate key data required to know how the current SARS-CoV-2 outbreak will unfold. Most crucially, serological studies could indicate the extent of population immunity, whether immunity wanes, and at what rate. In our model, this rate is the key modulator of the total SARS-CoV-2 incidence in the coming years. While long-lasting immunity would lead to lower overall incidence of infection, it would also complicate vaccine efficacy trials by contributing to low case numbers when those trials are conducted, as occurred with Zika virus (49). In our assessment of control measures in the initial pandemic period, we assumed that SARS-CoV-2 infection induces immunity that lasts for at least two years, but social distancing measures may need to be extended if SARS-CoV-2 immunity wanes more rapidly. In addition, if serological data reveals the existence of many undocumented asymptomatic infections that lead to immunity (50), less social distancing may be required. Serology could also indicate whether cross-immunity exists between SARS-CoV-2, HCoV-OC43, and HCoV-HKU1, which could affect the post-pandemic transmission of SARS-CoV-2. We anticipate that such cross-immunity would lessen the intensity of SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks, though some speculate that antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) induced by prior coronavirus infection may increase susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 and exacerbate the severity of infection (51, 52). At present, there is limited data describing ADE between coronaviruses, but if it does exist it may promote the cocirculation of betacoronavirus strains. To implement intermittent social distancing, it will be necessary to carry out widespread viral testing for surveillance to monitor when the prevalence thresholds that trigger the beginning or end of distancing have been crossed. Without such surveillance, critical care bed availability might be used as a proxy for prevalence, but this metric is far from optimal since the lag between distancing and peak critical care demand could lead to frequent overrunning of critical care resources. Critical care resources are also at greater risk of being overrun if the infectious, latent, and hospitalized periods follow peaked distributions (e.g. gamma versus exponential). Measuring the distributions of these times, and not just their means, will help to set more effective thresholds for distancing interventions. Under some circumstances, intense social distancing may be able to reduce the prevalence of COVID-19 enough to warrant a shift in strategy to contact tracing and containment efforts, as has occurred in many parts of China (21, 23, 53). Still, countries that have achieved this level of control of the outbreak should prepare for the possibility of substantial resurgences of infection and a return to social distancing measures, especially if seasonal forcing contributes to a rise in transmissibility in the winter. Moreover, a winter peak for COVID-19 would coincide with peak influenza incidence (54), further straining health care systems. Treatments or vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 would reduce the duration and intensity of social distancing required to maintain control of the epidemic. Treatments could reduce the proportion of infections that require critical care and could reduce the duration of infectiousness, which would both directly and indirectly (through a reduction in R 0 ) reduce the demand for critical care resources. A vaccine would accelerate the accumulation of immunity in the population, reducing the overall length of the epidemic and averting infections that might have resulted in a need for critical care. Furthermore, if there have been many undocumented immunizing infections, the herd immunity threshold may be reached sooner than our models suggest. Still, SARS-CoV-2 has demonstrated an ability to challenge robust healthcare systems, and the development and widespread adoption of pharmaceutical interventions will take months at best, so a period of sustained or intermittent social distancing will almost certainly be necessary. In summary, the total incidence of COVID-19 illness over the next five years will depend critically upon whether or not it enters into regular circulation after the initial pandemic wave, which in turn depends primarily upon the duration of immunity that SARS-CoV-2 infection imparts. The intensity and timing of pandemic and post-pandemic outbreaks will depend on the time of year when widespread SARS-CoV-2 infection becomes established and, to a lesser degree, upon the magnitude of seasonal variation in transmissibility and the level of cross-immunity that exists between the betacoronaviruses. Social distancing strategies could reduce the extent to which SARS-CoV-2 infections strain health care systems. Highly-effective distancing could reduce SARS-CoV-2 incidence enough to make a strategy based on contact tracing and quarantine feasible, as in South Korea and Singapore. Less effective one-time distancing efforts may result in a prolonged single-peak epidemic, with the extent of strain on the healthcare system and the required duration of distancing depending on the effectiveness. Intermittent distancing may be required into 2022 unless critical care capacity is increased substantially or a treatment or vaccine becomes available. The authors are aware that prolonged distancing, even if intermittent, is likely to have profoundly negative economic, social, and educational consequences. Our goal in modeling such policies is not to endorse them but to identify likely trajectories of the epidemic under alternative approaches, identify complementary interventions such as expanding ICU capacity and identifying treatments to reduce ICU demand, and to spur innovative ideas (55) to expand the list of options to bring the pandemic under long-term control. Our model presents a variety of scenarios intended to anticipate possible SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics under specific assumptions. We do not take a position on the advisability of these scenarios given the economic burden that sustained distancing may impose, but we note the potentially catastrophic burden on the healthcare system that is predicted if distancing is poorly effective and/or not sustained for long enough. The model will have to be tailored to local conditions and updated as more accurate data become available. Longitudinal serological studies are urgently required to determine the extent and duration of immunity to SARS-CoV-2, and epidemiological surveillance should be maintained in the coming years to anticipate the possibility of resurgence.

Europe‚Äôs leaders are sketching out strategies for reactivating economies battered by the coronavirus, with Germany poised to examine an easing of restrictions on public life and Denmark ready to reopen primary schools.
Governments are trying to balance the need to mitigate economic damage against the risk of a resurgence of the disease. The number of new cases in Europe has stabilized in recent days though more than 50,000 people have died and the fatalities continue to climb.
While officials remain cautious, German Chancellor Angela Merkel is due to discuss plans to scale back curbs on activity with regional premiers on Wednesday. The European Commission has drafted proposals to coordinate moves across the continent.
‚ÄúAt the same time, it‚Äôs clear that the danger is a long way from being averted,‚Äù German Health Minister Jens Spahn said in a tweet Tuesday evening. ‚ÄúA step-by-step return to normality is only possible if we continue to keep the outbreak under control.‚Äù
Danish primary-school children will return to class Wednesday and hospitals will begin conducting non-critical procedures for patients suffering from conditions other than Covid-19. Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said her government‚Äôs efforts have been so successful that the country may conduct a broader rollback of its lockdown than originally planned.
Austria on Tuesday became the first European Union nation to ease restrictions by opening some shops, while leaving schools closed.
Italy reported the smallest rise in infections in just over a month Tuesday, though the daily number of fatalities rose to 602 compared with 566 on Monday. Spain had the lowest number of new cases since March 20, increasing pressure on the government to relax a state of emergency.
France‚Äôs latest death toll of 762, and an increase in reported cases of 6,524, were each the highest in four days. The number of patients in intensive care declined for a sixth day.

The commission cautioned leaders that they will have to be prepared to re-impose lockdowns if the number of infections starts to spike again. In guidelines to be unveiled Wednesday, it will warn that the easing should be gradual and begin only when infections significantly decline for a sustained period; hospitals have enough beds, drugs and equipment; and large-scale testing, tracing and quarantine capacity is in place.
Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte‚Äôs administration is considering allowing some companies in the automobile, fashion, design and metalworking sectors to reopen later this month but the priority remains the health of employees, according to two officials who asked not to be named discussing confidential plans.
‚ÄúItaly is pretty much like the first competitor to head down the ski run, because of our long lockdown,‚Äù Luca Richeldi, a pulmonologist at Rome‚Äôs Agostino Gemelli hospital and a member of the scientific and medical committee advising the government, said in an interview. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt want to make mistakes for our country, or that could be replicated by other nations.‚Äù

207,255f5b21-6463-4dcf-a713-69c93bf77aa0,eduardo.garcia,https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/03/covid-19-economic-crisis-recession-economists/,COVID-19: How economists think governments should respond,"Leading economists urge governments to bring out the ‚Äòbig artillery‚Äô to fight the economic fallout caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Unconventional policy options such as ‚Äòhelicopter money‚Äô should be on the table, they argue.
Governments will need to reduce personal and corporate bankruptcies, ensure people have money to keep spending even if they‚Äôre not working, and increase public investment and healthcare spending, the economists say.
As the list of countries shutting down in the face of the coronavirus pandemic continues to grow, leading economists from around the world are calling for radical action to fight the economic fallout.
More than 40 high-profile economists, including IMF Chief Economist Gita Gopinath and former President Barack Obama‚Äôs top economic adviser, Jason Furman, have contributed to an eBook from the Centre for Economic Policy Research (CEPR) in which they urge governments to act quickly and do whatever it takes to keep the lights on.
They advocate using heavy fiscal firepower for a ‚Äúwhatever-it-takes‚Äù economic response to the COVID-19 crisis.
Among the drastic measures proposed are: ‚Äòhelicopter money,‚Äô where everyone gets a no-strings-attached handout; Eurozone countries using eurobonds to issue debt together rather than individually; and state investment banks providing unlimited emergency lending to firms.
Flattening two curves
Containment measures flatten the infection curve, but steepen the recession curve. Image: Centre for Economic Policy Research (CEPR)
Though the economists say it‚Äôs still too early to tell how bad the economic damage will be, they‚Äôre certain it will be large ‚Äì the pandemic is destroying lives and livelihoods around the world.
The measures necessary to contain the virus ‚Äì quarantine, social distancing, school, university and daycare closures, shutdowns of non-essential businesses, and asking people to work from home ‚Äì are bringing economies to a screeching halt.
What is the World Economic Forum doing about the coronavirus outbreak? A new strain of Coronavirus, COVID 19, is spreading around the world, causing deaths and major disruption to the global economy. Responding to this crisis requires global cooperation among governments, international organizations and the business community, which is at the centre of the World Economic Forum‚Äôs mission as the International Organization for Public-Private Cooperation. The Forum has created the COVID Action Platform, a global platform to convene the business community for collective action, protect people‚Äôs livelihoods and facilitate business continuity, and mobilize support for the COVID-19 response. The platform is created with the support of the World Health Organization and is open to all businesses and industry groups, as well as other stakeholders, aiming to integrate and inform joint action. As an organization, the Forum has a track record of supporting efforts to contain epidemics. In 2017, at our Annual Meeting, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) was launched ‚Äì bringing together experts from government, business, health, academia and civil society to accelerate the development of vaccines. CEPI is currently supporting the race to develop a vaccine against this strand of the coronavirus.
‚ÄúWe are facing a joint health and economic crisis of unprecedented proportions in recent history,‚Äù writes Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas of the University of California, Berkeley, in a chapter on how to flatten both the infection and recession curves.
But there are fiscal policies governments can use to prevent or limit catastrophic collapses, which Gourinchas says are like the ‚Äúintensive care units, beds and ventilators of the economic system.‚Äù For example, central banks can provide emergency liquidity to the financial sector.
Reducing economic scar tissue

To avoid deep, long-lasting damage to economies, governments will need to reduce the number of personal and corporate bankruptcies, ensure people have money to keep spending even if they‚Äôre not working, and increase public investment and healthcare spending, the authors write.
Put another way, they need to act now to ‚Äúreduce the accumulation of economic scar tissue‚Äù.","['Rosamond Hutt', 'Jeremy', 'Rossman', 'The Conversation', 'Jordi Sales', 'Somik', 'Lall', 'Sameh Wahba', 'World Bank', 'Written By']",

Wenngleich die Pandemie das wirtschaftliche und gesellschaftliche Leben noch auf Monate bestimmen wird, gelte es nun, √ºber die akuten Einschr√§nkungen zentraler Grundrechte (wie der Bewegungsfreiheit) hinaus zu gehen und Kriterien und Strategien f√ºr die allm√§hliche R√ºckkehr in die Normalit√§t zu entwickeln. Voraussetzung f√ºr eine solche allm√§hliche Lockerung sei, so die Stellungnahme, dass sich die Neuinfektionen auf einem niedrigen Niveau stabilisieren, das Gesundheitssystem nicht √ºberlastet wird, Infizierte zunehmend identifiziert werden und die Schutzma√ünahmen (Hygienema√ünahmen, Mund-Nasen-Schutz, Distanzregeln) eingehalten werden.
Das Papier thematisiert Fragen der daten- und modellgeleiteten Entscheidungsunterst√ºtzung und Perspektiven, die in die Abw√§gung von Rechtsg√ºtern einzubeziehen sind. Vorgeschlagen werden weiterhin Empfehlungen zur Abfederung von psychologischen und sozialen Auswirkungen. Zudem werden Ma√ünahmen f√ºr den Wirtschafts- und Finanzsektor sowie den Bildungsbereich erl√§utert. Als Rahmen daf√ºr benennt die Stellungnahme folgende Prinzipien: der Schutz jedes einzelnen Menschen und die Erm√∂glichung eines menschenw√ºrdigen Lebens sowie die stufenweise zu realisierende Wiederherstellung der gesellschaftlichen, wirtschaftlichen, politischen und kulturellen Handlungsf√§higkeit der B√ºrgerinnen und B√ºrger. Alle Ma√ünahmen sollen sich an den Leitkonzepten von Nachhaltigkeit und Resilienz orientieren.
Die dritte Stellungnahme erg√§nzt die beiden Stellungnahmen zu gesundheitspolitischen Fragen im Umgang mit der Pandemie vom 3. April und vom 21. M√§rz. Diese Empfehlungen gelten weiterhin. Dar√ºber hinaus, so die Wissenschaftlerinnen und Wissenschaftler, d√ºrfe die aktuell stark auf COVID-19-Patienten konzentrierte Versorgung nicht zu einer Unterversorgung anderer Erkrankter f√ºhren. Dabei seien ausreichende Intensiv- und Schutzkapazit√§ten f√ºr neue Ausbr√ºche der Pandemie als Reserve vorzuhalten. Das Gesundheitswesen solle analysiert und entsprechend angepasst werden. Au√üerdem m√ºsse die Forschung zu wirksamen Medikamenten und die Entwicklung von schnell und in gro√üen Mengen verf√ºgbaren Impfstoffen massiv vorangetrieben werden. Die Nationale Akademie der Wissenschaften wird den Verlauf der Pandemie weiter aufmerksam und aktiv begleiten.

Die Leopoldina hat eine erste Ad-hoc-Stellungnahme zu m√∂glichen gesundheitspolitischen Handlungsoptionen gegen die weitere Ausbreitung des Virus ver√∂ffentlicht. Die dazugeh√∂rige Arbeitsgruppe wird die Nachjustierung und Ausgestaltung von Ma√ünahmen mit weiteren Ver√∂ffentlichungen unterst√ºtzen und begleiten. Eine weitere Arbeitsgruppe, die sich mit den rechtlichen, wirtschaftlichen, sozialen und psychischen Aspekten der Pandemie befasst, wurde eingerichtet.
21. M√§rz 2020 ‚Äì Nationalakademie Leopoldina legt Ad-hoc-Stellungnahme vor
Eine interdisziplin√§re Arbeitsgruppe der Leopoldina hat sich mit medizinischen Perspektiven der Pandemie befasst. Die daraus resultierende Ad-hoc-Stellungnahme ‚ÄûCoronavirus-Pandemie in Deutschland: Herausforderungen und Interventionsm√∂glichkeiten‚Äú diskutiert m√∂gliche gesundheitspolitische Handlungsoptionen gegen die weitere Ausbreitung des Coronavirus in Deutschland.
Die von der Bundesregierung und den Bundesl√§ndern ergriffenen Ma√ünahmen zur Eind√§mmung der aktuellen Coronavirus-Pandemie sind derzeit dringend erforderlich und entsprechen der durch die Pandemie ausgel√∂sten Bedrohung. Sie bestehen aus dem Dreiklang: Eind√§mmung der Epidemie, Schutz der vulnerablen Bev√∂lkerung sowie einer gezielten Kapazit√§tserh√∂hung im √∂ffentlichen Gesundheitswesen und im Versorgungssystem. F√ºr die Wirksamkeit und Notwendigkeit einiger dieser Ma√ünahmen gibt es wissenschaftliche Hinweise, andere werden aufgrund von Hochrechnungen und politischen √úberlegungen vorgeschlagen. Die Entwicklung von Medikamenten und Impfstoffen muss mit h√∂chster Priorit√§t verfolgt werden. Hierbei m√ºssen medizinethische Aspekte ber√ºcksichtigt werden.
Es deutet sich an, dass zum jetzigen Zeitpunkt ein deutschlandweiter tempor√§rer ‚ÄûShutdown‚Äú (ca. 3 Wochen) mit konsequenter r√§umlicher Distanzierung aus wissenschaftlicher Sicht empfehlenswert ist. Dabei m√ºssen notwendige und gesundheitserhaltende Aktivit√§ten weiterhin m√∂glich bleiben. Alle Anstrengungen der n√§chsten Wochen und Monate sollten darauf gerichtet werden, dass pharmazeutische Interventionen und Schutzma√ünahmen im √∂ffentlichen Raum verf√ºgbar werden und Kapazit√§ten zur Testung von Verdachtsf√§llen und Einreisenden vorhanden sind. In der Zeit des ‚ÄûShutdowns‚Äú m√ºssen Vorbereitungen f√ºr das kontrollierte und selektive Hochfahren des √∂ffentlichen Lebens und der Wirtschaft getroffen werden.
Mit einem tempor√§ren ‚ÄûShutdown‚Äú hat die Arbeitsgruppe eine bundeseinheitliche stringente Ausgangsbeschr√§nkung bis mindestens nach Ostern diskutiert. Dann w√§re die Situation neu zu evaluieren. Dies w√ºrde kein Arbeitsverbot, kein Einkaufsverbot von Lebensmitteln und auch keine Unterbindung von Spazierg√§ngen im Familienkreis bedeuten. Ziel ist die konsequente Nutzung von Homeoffice, wenn irgend m√∂glich. Entscheidend ist auch eine disziplinierte r√§umliche Distanzierung von Personen von 2 Metern, insbesondere, wenn sie nicht in einem Haushalt wohnen.

As the coronavirus outbreak shows signs of peaking in Europe, many countries are planning on easing draconian lockdown measures one bit at a time.
Austria is set to be the among the first EU members to start relaxing the rules after setting out a detailed plan yesterday to reopen smaller shops on April 14 and then larger ones in May. Denmark plans on lifting its lockdown after Easter but will ask people to ‚Äòwork in a more staggered way‚Äô to prevent overcrowding on public transport.
‚ÄòPhase two‚Äô of Italy‚Äôs fight against coronavirus aims to teach the nation to ‚Äòlive with the virus‚Äô with widespread tests and the wearing of face masks. Provided new infections remain low, Germany plans to re-open schools on a regional basis and allow some restaurants to let people in.
As economies across the continent have taken a hit from sweeping emergency measures, many will be raring to get back to business, but officials have warned society can‚Äôt go back ‚Äòfrom 0 to 100‚Äô overnight.

Having suffered the most Covid-19 fatalities in the world, Italy is now planning to ‚Äòcreate the conditions to live with the virus‚Äô until a vaccine is created.
The country has recorded 16,523 deaths but after the daily rate fell to its lowest in two weeks on Sunday, the government is now considering easing its stricter emergency measures.

Many Italian companies and academics are pressing the government to reopen factories to prevent an economic catastrophe, as the world watches how the first western country to impose a lockdown can extricate itself from the unprecedented measures.
Rome imposed a nationwide lockdown on March 9 when the new virus, which emerged in China, had already killed more than 460 people.
Two weeks later, Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte announced that non-essential businesses, including car, clothing and furniture production, would have to close until April 3.

Health minister Roberto Speranza told La Republica: ‚ÄòThere are difficult months ahead. Our task is to create the conditions to live with the virus,‚Äô at least until a vaccine is developed.‚Äô
Italy‚Äôs lockdown is set to last until April 13 but is expected to be extended. As non-essential shops and businesses are gradually re-opened, strict social-distancing guidelines will have to remain in place and more rules are likely to be put in place requiring people to use personal protective equipment such as face masks.

So far, officials have said that work restrictions would probably be lifted on a sector-by-sector rather than geographical basis.
A hospital network designed specifically for Covid-19 patients would be set up to help relieve some of the burden from intensive care doctors.
Testing would be made more widespread and ‚Äòcontact tracing‚Äô would be extended using smartphone apps to make it easier to locate and contain a second wave of outbreaks.
There have been more than 132,000 confirmed cases in Italy so far.
Austria
Austria plans to start re-opening smaller shops after Easter (Picture: Reuters)
Like most countries in Europe, Austria has ordered non-essential shops to close their doors and for people only to venture outside for a specific set of reasons.
But as the daily increase in infections fell to single digits, the Alpine republic announced yesterday plans to start re-opening stores while expanding a requirement to wear face masks.
Chancellor Sebastian Kurz said the decision to act early and with bold restrictions is starting to pay off.
Provided Austrians stick to lockdown measures for now and infections don‚Äôt suddenly spike, non-essential shops of 400 square metres or less are to re-open along with DIY and garden stores.

If all goes well other shops, hairdressers and shopping malls would be allowed to open their doors from May 1 but would have to maintain a limit of one customer per 20 square metres.

Shoppers are already required to wear masks at supermarkets and pharmacies of more than 400 metres and this requirement will be extended to public transport as the lockdown is eased.
Hotels and restaurants could start to re-open in mid-May along with schools, while public events will remain banned until the end of June.
As of yesterday Austria had recorded more than 12,000 coronavirus cases and 220 deaths.
Germany

As soon it achieves an infection rate of less than one person per patient, Germany is happy to start easing its social restrictions ‚Äòstep-by-step‚Äô.
Schools could be re-opened on a regional basis and shops and restaurants could be allowed to go back to business, as long as they stick to a limit on the number of people in closed rooms.
Wearing face masks may also be made compulsory in public buildings and on trains or buses. Chancellor Angela Merkel has not set a date for restrictions being lifted.
Germany is among countries supporting the idea of antibody tests being distributed to allow those who are likely to have already caught and developed immunity to coronavirus to go back to work.
This would also mean protective medical equipment could be prioritised for those who don‚Äôt have immunity, but some scientists have warned we might not know enough about Covid-19 yet to sanction so-called ‚Äòimmunity passports‚Äô.

Similarly to Italy, Germany is looking at how South Korea got its numbers down through phone tracking.
Today the country‚Äôs public health authority launched a smartwatch app in partnership with health-technology startup Thryve to help monitor the spread of Covid-19 and analyse whether measures to contain the pandemic are working.
The Corona-Datenspende (Corona Data Donation) app gathers vital signs from volunteers wearing smartwatches or fitness trackers ‚Äì including pulse, temperature and sleep ‚Äì to analyse whether they are symptomatic of the flu-like illness.
Germany could use smartphone tracking to keep tabs on any new infections (Picture: Getty Images)
Results will be represented in an interactive online map that would make it possible ‚Äì together with other data inputs ‚Äì for the health authorities and the general public to assess new infections down to postcode level.
Germany has the fourth highest COVID-19 caseload behind the United States, Spain and Italy at nearly 100,000 but has kept fatalities down to a relatively low 1,600 thanks to early and extensive testing.
Authorities have been more cautious in using digital technology to fight the coronavirus, due to strict data privacy laws and distrust of any surveillance measures reminiscent of Nazi- or communist-era rule.
Germany has reported more than 100,000 cases of the coronavirus and more than 1,800 deaths.
France
Toulouse has begun to disinfect its streets to stem the spread of coronavirus (Picture: PA/NurPhoto)
With 98,984 cases and 8,911 deaths, France is not quite at the point of easing its lockdown.
Interior minister Laurent Nunez said ‚Äòthe end of confinement is not yet on the cards and a deadline has not been set‚Äô.
Last week Prime Minister Edouard Philippe said lifting measures would not be done in one go and said the government is ‚Äòfighting hour by hour‚Äô to prevent shortages of medicines.
As businesses were ordered to close in a bid to lessen the number of patients filling hospital wards, France‚Äôs overall economic activity had been slashed by 35%.
Even stricter measures are being introduced in Paris after too many locals headed outside to enjoy the sunny weekend (Picture: Getty Images)
Authorities in Paris have banned all outdoor sports activities between 10 a.m. and 7 p.m. after residents took to the streets in numbers to enjoy the weekend‚Äôs sunny weather.
Mayor Anne Hidalgo and police prefect Didier Lallement say Parisians should limit their movement to urgent or indispensable outings.
Starting tomorrow, Parisians can only exercise outdoors when a ‚Äòstreet crowd is at its lowest‚Äô.
Locals were previously allowed to exercise outdoors for an hour while carrying a form explaining the reason why they were going out.
France has nearly 9,000 dead and some 100,000 known infections across the country.
Spain
Madrid‚Äôs Gran Via stands empty as the country remains on lockdown (Picture: REX)
Faced with one of the worst outbreaks in the world, the rate of infection is starting to flatten, giving hope Spanish authorities.
If the promising trend continues economic restrictions could be lifted after the Easter break and some non-essential staff could go back to work.
But shops, restaurants and bars are likely to remain closed until at least April 26.
Economy minister Nadia Calvino says the government are discussing an exit strategy and said it ‚Äòcannot be a 0 to 100 process in one day‚Äô.
One million testing kits were due to arrive in Spain on Sunday and Monday with the aim of rolling out a ‚Äòrapid screening‚Äô programme in nursing homes and hospitals.
It is not clear whether workers going back to business will have to wear face masks or gloves by law.
Today the Spanish death rate rose again after falling for four consecutive days.
Another 743 patients have lost their lives over the past 24 hours, bringing the total number of fatalities in the country to 13,798.
The health ministry said total number of Covid-19 cases rose to 140,510 from 135,032 yesterday.
Denmark

As long as there is not a surge in new infections, prime minister Mette Frederiksen said she hopes for a ‚Äògradual, controlled and quiet reopening of Denmark‚Äô after Easter.
The Danish government enforced a lockdown on March 11, closing schools, nurseries, restaurants, cafes and gyms and closing the borders to most foreigners.
The government wants people to go back to work ‚Äòin a more staggered way‚Äô so public transport isn‚Äôt overloaded, but it is not clear how this will be achieved.
Frederiksen added: ‚ÄòWe are not going to be able to squeeze up close together in trains, buses and subways in the way we have become accustomed to. Or stand very close together with a whole lot of other people and have a good party together.‚Äô
Denmark said it is planning to reopen nurseries and primary schools for pupils aged up to 11 on April 15.
Frederiksen said her government planned to open schools for younger students first because the requirement to care for them created a greater burden on society.
She said restaurants, bars and cafes would remain closed for now, and churches, libraries, sports venues and shopping centres would remain shut until at least May 10.
Border controls and a ban on gatherings of more than 10 people will be kept in place until that same date at the very earliest.

210,082b7462-d69c-45ce-aaff-63a96b5e70d0,eduardo.garcia,https://www.vox.com/2020/4/10/21215494/coronavirus-plans-social-distancing-economy-recession-depression-unemployment,I‚Äôve read the plans to reopen the economy. They‚Äôre scary.,"Over the past few days, I‚Äôve been reading the major plans for what comes after social distancing. You can read them, too. There‚Äôs one from the right-leaning American Enterprise Institute, the left-leaning Center for American Progress, Harvard University‚Äôs Safra Center for Ethics, and Nobel Prize-winning economist Paul Romer.
I thought, perhaps naively, that reading them would be a comfort ‚Äî at least then I‚Äôd be able to imagine the path back to normal. But it wasn‚Äôt. In different ways, all these plans say the same thing: Even if you can imagine the herculean political, social, and economic changes necessary to manage our way through this crisis effectively, there is no normal for the foreseeable future. Until there‚Äôs a vaccine, the United States either needs economically ruinous levels of social distancing, a digital surveillance state of shocking size and scope, or a mass testing apparatus of even more shocking size and intrusiveness.
The AEI, CAP, and Harvard plans aren‚Äôt identical, but they‚Äôre similar. All of them feature a period of national lockdown ‚Äî in which extreme social distancing is deployed to ‚Äúflatten the curve‚Äù and health and testing capacity is surged to ‚Äúraise the line.‚Äù That‚Äôs phase one. Phase two triggers after a set period (45 days for CAP, three months for Harvard) or, in the AEI plan, after 14 days of falling cases and a series of health supply markers.
All of them then imagine a phase two, which relaxes ‚Äî but does not end ‚Äî social distancing while implementing testing and surveillance on a mass scale. This is where you must begin imagining the almost unimaginable.
The CAP and Harvard plans both foresee a digital pandemic surveillance state in which virtually every American downloads an app to their phone that geotracks their movements, so if they come into contact with anyone who later is found to have Covid-19, they can be alerted and a period of social quarantine can begin. Similarly, people would scan QR codes when boarding mass transit or entering other high-risk public areas. And GPS tracking could be used to enforce quarantine on those who test positive with the disease, as is being done in Taiwan.
To state the obvious: The technological and political obstacles are massive. While similar efforts have borne fruit in Singapore and South Korea, the US is a very different country, with a more mistrustful, individualistic culture. Already, polling shows that 70 percent of Republicans, and 46 percent of Democrats, strongly oppose using cellphone data to enforce quarantine orders.
The CAP plan tries to answer these concerns, but in trying to imagine an answer, it shows the difficulty of the task. It‚Äôs worth quoting the CAP proposal at length:
The entity that hosts the data must be a trusted, nonprofit organization‚Äînot private technology companies or the federal government. The app could be developed for a purely public health nonprofit entity such as the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials (ASTHO)‚Äîan organization that represents state health officials‚Äîwhich would host the data. Congress or foundations could provide funding to develop and operate the technology. States licensing the app could provide ongoing operational funding to ASTHO, provided states receive federal funding for this purpose. ‚Ä¢ Additional protections must include the following: ‚Ä¢ The amount of data needed and shared must be minimized ‚Ä¢ This system must be transparent ‚Ä¢ Data must be collected, secured, and stored within the United States ‚Ä¢ Data must be automatically deleted after every 45 days ‚Ä¢ The sharing of data with the federal government, except for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), must be prohibited ‚Ä¢ The sharing of data with state and local government agencies that are not public health agencies must be prohibited ‚Ä¢ The sharing of data with third parties and the sale of data must be prohibited ‚Ä¢ Any data shared publicly must be anonymized As a condition of receiving a COVID-19 test in the future, individuals may be required to download the app, which would include their test result. For others, the app would be voluntary, although the vast majority of people could be expected to download it to see if there are cases in their neighborhood or near their workplace.
I‚Äôm not here to say that this, or anything else, is impossible. But it is light-years beyond the kind of political leadership and public-private coordination we‚Äôve seen thus far. Who is going to spearhead the effort? President Donald Trump? House Speaker Nancy Pelosi? Bill Gates? Who is trusted enough, in this country in this moment, to shape this? And even if they could pass it, can we build it, and do so quickly? Force adherence to it, and quickly? Are we really going to deny tests to anyone who refuses to download the surveillance app? And what about communities with less digital savvy?
The alternative to mass surveillance is mass testing. Romer‚Äôs proposal is to deploy testing on a scale no one else is contemplating ‚Äî 22 million tests per day ‚Äî so that the entire country is being tested every 14 days, and anyone who tests positive can be quickly quarantined. He shows, in a series of useful simulations, that even if the test has a high false-negative rate, the retesting is sufficient to keep the virus contained, and thus the country can return to normalcy rapidly. Of the various plans, this one seems likeliest to permit a true and rapid economic recovery.
But it is hard to imagine a testing effort of this scale, too. So far, America is struggling to get into the millions of tests per week. This plan requires tens of millions per day. Most experts I‚Äôve spoken to doubt that‚Äôs realistic anytime soon, though some believe it‚Äôs possible, eventually. So far, we‚Äôve added testing capacity largely by repurposing existing labs and platforms. To add more, we need to build more labs, more machines, more tests. And there are already shortages of reagents, swabs, and health workers.
But even if those constraints could be overcome, how are these 22 million daily tests going to be administered? By whom? How do we enforce compliance? If you refuse to get tested, are you fined? Jailed? Cut off from government benefits? Would the Supreme Court consider a proposal like this constitutional?
The AEI proposal is the closest thing to a middle path between these plans. It‚Äôs more testing, but nothing approaching Romer‚Äôs hopes. It‚Äôs more contact tracing, but it doesn‚Äôt envision an IT-driven panopticon. But precisely for that reason, what it‚Äôs really describing is a yo-yo between extreme lockdown and lighter forms of social distancing, continuing until a vaccine is reached.
This, too, requires some imagination. Will governors who‚Äôve finally, at great effort, reopened parts of their economies really keep throwing them back into lockdown every time ICUs begin to fill? Will Trump have the stomach to push the country back into quarantine after he‚Äôs lifted social distancing guidelines? What if unemployment is 17 percent, and his approval rating is at 38 percent?
And even if the political hurdles could be cleared, it‚Äôs obvious, reading the AEI proposal, that there‚Äôll be no ‚ÄúV-shaped recovery‚Äù of the economy. Scott Gottlieb, the former FDA commissioner who helped craft the plan, says he thinks something like 80 percent of the economy will return ‚Äî that may sound like a lot, but it‚Äôs an economic collapse of Great Depression proportions.
I don‚Äôt want anyone to mistake this as an argument for surrendering to the disease. As unlikely as these futures may be, I think the do-nothing argument is even less plausible: It imagines that we simply let a highly lethal virus kill perhaps millions of Americans, hospitalize tens of millions more, and crush the health system, while the rest of us go about our daily economic and social business. That is, in my view, far less likely than the construction of a huge digital surveillance state. I care about my privacy, but not nearly so much as I care about my mother.
My point isn‚Äôt to criticize these plans when I have nothing better to offer. Indeed, my point isn‚Äôt to criticize them at all. It‚Äôs simply to note that these aren‚Äôt plans for returning to anything even approaching normal. They either envision life under a surveillance and testing state of dystopian (but perhaps necessary!) proportions, or they envision a long period of economic and public health pain, as we wrestle the disease down only to see it roar back, as seems to be happening in Singapore.
What‚Äôs even scarier to consider is that the debate between these plans is far beyond the political debate we‚Äôre actually having. As of now, the White House has neither chosen nor begun executing on a plan of its own. That‚Äôs a terrible abdication of leadership, but reading through the various proposals, you can see why it‚Äôs happened. Imagine you‚Äôre the president of the United States in an election year. Which of these futures, with all its costs and risks and pain, would you want to try and sell to the American people?
One final takeaway from all this: If there is literally anything more we can possibly do to accelerate the development of vaccines or therapeutics, we should do it.
Update: After I published this piece, Apple and Google jointly announced a project to embed voluntary contact tracing functionality in their phones, and make the data interoperable across iOS and Android. Read my colleagues at Recode and the Verge for more on that (and here‚Äôs some smart analysis from Casey Newton). And Danielle Allen, the head of Harvard‚Äôs Safra Center, wrote to tell me that they‚Äôll have a more detailed plan coming next week, and it will differ in some ways from the papers they‚Äôve released so far.

After the novel coronavirus made its way around the world, one country after another adopted harsh measures to stop SARS-CoV-2 from spreading and overwhelming hospitals. They have hit the pause button on their economies and their citizens' lives, stopping sports events, religious services, and other social gatherings. School closures in 188 countries affect more than 1.5 billion students. Borders are closed and businesses shuttered. While some countries are still seeing daily case numbers increase, others‚Äîfirst in Asia but increasingly in Europe‚Äîhave managed to bend the curve, slowing transmission of COVID-19.
But what is the exit strategy? ‚ÄúWe've managed to get to the life raft,‚Äù says epidemiologist Marc Lipsitch of the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health (HSPH). ‚ÄúBut I'm really unclear how we will get to the shore.‚Äù
As they seek a path forward, governments around the world must triangulate the health of their citizens, the freedoms of their population, and economic constraints. Could schools be reopened? Restaurants? Bars? Can people go back to their offices? ‚ÄúHow to relax the lockdown is not something around which there is a scientific consensus,‚Äù says Caroline Buckee, an epidemiologist at HSPH. Most researchers agree that reopening society will be a long haul, marked by trial and error. ‚ÄúIt's going to have to be something that we're going to have to take baby steps with,‚Äù says Megan Coffee, an infectious disease researcher at New York University.
The number to watch in the next phase may no longer be the actual number of cases per day, but what epidemiologists call the effective reproduction number, or R, which denotes how many people the average infected person infects in turn. If R is above 1, the outbreak grows; below 1 it shrinks. The goal of the current lockdowns is to push R well below 1. Once the pandemic is tamed, countries can try to loosen restrictions while keeping R hovering around 1, when each infected person on average infects one other person, keeping the number of new cases steady.
To regulate R, ‚ÄúGovernments will have to realize that there are basically three control knobs on the dashboard,‚Äù says Gabriel Leung, a modeler at the University of Hong Kong: isolating patients and tracing their contacts, border restrictions, and social distancing.
Turning the knobs Singapore, Hong Kong, and South Korea have all managed to keep their epidemics in check through aggressive use of the first control. They identify and isolate cases early and trace and quarantine their contacts, while often imposing only light restrictions on the rest of society. But this strategy depends on massively scaling up testing, which has been hampered by a scarcity of reagents and other materials everywhere. Contact tracing is also labor-intensive. Massachusetts is hiring 500 contact tracers, but a recent report by researchers at Johns Hopkins University estimated the United States as a whole needs to train about 100,000 people. Mobile phone apps could help by automatically identifying or alerting people who recently had contact with an infected person. But Western countries have yet to implement these systems. Google and Apple have teamed up to incorporate a contact tracing app in their operating systems. Germany, France, and other countries are developing apps based on a protocol called Pan-European Privacy Preserving Proximity Tracing. It relies on short-range Bluetooth signals to gauge the proximity between two devices without logging their exact locations, which helps sidestep some privacy concerns. But short of making these technologies compulsory, as China has done, how can a country ensure that enough people download an app for it to provide reliable information and influence the spread of disease? And what exactly counts as a contact? ‚ÄúIf I live in a big apartment block, am I going to be getting dozens of notifications a day?‚Äù asks epidemiologist Nicholas Davies of the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine (LSHTM). Davies adds that widespread use of the apps will further drive up the demand for testing. As to the second control knob, border restrictions, most countries have already banned entry to almost all noncitizens. Quarantining returning citizens, as New Zealand and Australia began to do in the past few weeks, further minimizes the risk of new introductions of the virus. Such measures are likely to remain in place for a while; the more a country reduces transmission domestically, the greater the risk that any new outbreaks will originate with travelers. And foreign visitors are generally harder to trace than citizens and more likely to stay at hotels and visit potential transmission hot spots, says Alessandro Vespignani, a disease modeler at Northeastern University. ‚ÄúAs soon as you reopen to travelers, that could be something that the contact tracing system is not able to cope with,‚Äù he says. The third dashboard dial, social distancing, is the backbone of the current strategy, which has slowed the spread of the virus. But it also comes at the greatest economic and social cost, and many countries hope the constraints can be relaxed as case isolation and contact tracing help keep the virus in check. In Europe, Austria took the lead by opening small shops on 14 April. Other stores and malls are scheduled to follow on 1 May, and restaurants maybe a few weeks later. A 13 April report from the German National Academy of Sciences argued for slowly reopening schools, starting with the youngest children, while staggering break times and making masks mandatory. But French President Emmanuel Macron has said France's lockdown will remain in place until 11 May. Choosing a prudent path is difficult, Buckee says, in part because no controlled experiments have compared the effectiveness of different social distancing measures. ‚ÄúBecause we don't have really strong evidence,‚Äù she says, ‚Äúit's quite hard to make evidence-based policy decisions about how to go back.‚Äù But Lipsitch says that as authorities around the world choose different paths forward, comparisons could be revealing. ‚ÄúI think there's going to be a lot of experimentation, not on purpose, but because of politics and local situations,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúHopefully the world will learn from that.‚Äù Finding out how any particular measure affects R is not straightforward, because infections that occur today can take weeks to show up in disease reports. In 2004, mathematician Jacco Wallinga of the Dutch National Institute for Public Health and the Environment and colleagues published a statistical method to estimate R in real time, which is now used around the world. Researchers are also incorporating data on mobility patterns and people's behavior to make the estimates more accurate. Having real-time estimates of R is important, says Adam Kucharski, a modeler at LSHTM: ‚ÄúIf governments put a measure in or lift it, they can get a sense of what the immediate implications are, rather than having to wait,‚Äù he says. There's one other, unknown factor that will determine how safe it is to loosen the reins: immunity. Every single person who becomes infected and develops immunity makes it harder for the virus to spread. ‚ÄúIf we get 30% or 40% of the population immune, that really starts to change that whole picture, it helps us a lot,‚Äù because it would bring R down by the same percentage, says Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities. GRAPHIC: CENTRE FOR MATHEMATICAL MODELING OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES/CC BY 4.0, ADAPTED BY X. LIU/SCIENCE Immunity will inevitably build up as more people become infected, but some researchers argue for ramping up immunity more quickly, by letting the virus spread in younger people, who are less susceptible to severe illness, while ‚Äúcocooning‚Äù more atrisk patients, such as the elderly. The United Kingdom floated this ‚Äúherd immunity‚Äù idea in February but backed away from it, as did the Netherlands. Some scientists say other countries should consider it once the strain that the first wave of cases has put on their health care systems eases. ‚ÄúIs it better to have a controlled burn in younger populations right now than it is to prevent it? I think that's a very important conversation to have,‚Äù Osterholm says. Skeptics doubt that vulnerable populations could really be protected. In many countries, multiple generations live under one roof, and young people work at nursing homes. Nor are scientists certain that COVID-19 produces robust, long-lasting immunity. Several studies seek to address these questions.",['Kai Kupferschmidt'],2020-04-17 00:00:00

Credit: Chine Nouvelle/SIPA/Shutterstock
For the first time in months, the Chinese province of Hubei, where the coronavirus first emerged, is getting attention for a good reason. COVID-19 cases there have dropped to practically zero, and last week authorities lifted travel restrictions in and out of the province, some 60 days after much of it was dramatically locked down. Now scientists ‚Äî and the rest of the world ‚Äî are watching closely to see whether easing the intense measures to keep people apart results in an emergence of new cases. An early analysis suggests that, so far, these fears have not come to pass.
What China‚Äôs coronavirus response can teach the rest of the world
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs time to relax the lockdown, but we need to be alert for a potential second wave of infections,‚Äù says Ben Cowling, an epidemiologist at the University of Hong Kong, who will be following the situation in China. If a second wave comes, Cowling would expect to see it emerge by the end of April.
How things unfold in Hubei ‚Äî and across China ‚Äî will be relevant to many European nations and some US states that have restricted travel inside their borders, closed most businesses, schools and universities and told people to stay at home, in an attempt to halt the pathogen‚Äôs spread. Modelling of the UK outbreak suggests that the country‚Äôs social distancing measures, including school and university closures, might be needed for large parts of the next two years to keep the proportion of people with severe COVID-19 infections in hospital at manageable levels.
But if China can show that it can lift its lockdown without a significant re-appearance of COVID-19, it might be possible that such protracted restrictions won‚Äôt be necessary.
Extensive testing
Chinese provinces will now use extensive testing and contact tracing to pinpoint new infections, and will maintain some social-distancing practices to prevent a resurgence. The country has also closed its borders to everyone but citizens to prevent cases from being imported. Returning residents will be quarantined for 14 days.
But some researchers say that the situation in China is different because its government acted aggressively, using social-distancing measures to slow down the spread and extensive testing and isolating of infected people to stamp out potential transmission sources. This strategy helped the country contain the outbreak. But other nations, such as Italy and Spain, have focused mainly on slowing the virus ‚Äî through social distancing ‚Äî without intensive testing and contact tracing. They will face more challenges when trying to return to life before the pandemic, says Cowling.
And yet, the risk of new outbreaks in China is high given the ease with which the virus passes between people, and the possibility that some infections still linger undetected, says Gabriel Leung, an infectious-disease researcher at the University of Hong Kong. It‚Äôs possible that one lockdown might not be enough, and severe efforts to suppress the virus might be needed again, he says. ‚ÄúThe tension between health, protecting the economy and emotional well-being will vex every government for the foreseeable future.‚Äù
Restrictions ease
Life in Hubei ‚Äî home to roughly 60 million people ‚Äî hasn‚Äôt returned to normal yet, but people are slowly leaving their homes and returning to work, and factories are reopening. Universities, schools and child-care centres remain closed pending ‚Äúa scientific assessment of the epidemic control situation‚Äù, say government authorities. And travel in and out of the provincial capital, Wuhan, remains restricted until 8 April. Until then, people will need to be tested for the virus to come and go. Since 18 March, there has been only one new case reported in Hubei.
A UK team has modelled whether the increasing movement following the easing of travel restrictions in the six Chinese provinces with the highest number of COVID-19 cases resulted in a surge of new infections. In these provinces ‚Äî Hubei, Beijing, Guangdong, Henan, Hunan and Zhejiang ‚Äî the lockdowns helped to reduce new COVID-19 cases to near zero.
What the cruise-ship outbreaks reveal about COVID-19
The team, led by infectious-disease researchers Neil Ferguson and Steven Riley at Imperial College London, found that as movement and economic activity in these regions increased in late February for all provinces except Hubei, the number of new infections stayed near zero. As activity restarted in Hubei in March, the numbers of new cases remained low. The analysis concludes that after containing the virus with the severe lockdowns, ‚ÄúChina has successfully exited their stringent social-distancing policy to some degree.‚Äù
‚ÄúSo far, so good,‚Äù says Andrew Tatem, an emerging-disease researcher at the University of Southampton, UK. But the findings must be approached with some caution, he adds. The movement and economic activity levels in the six regions that the group measured were only half of what they were before the outbreak, except in Zhejiang province, where it appears to have matched pre-pandemic levels. There might also be a lag between the increase in activity and reports of new cases. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre at the ‚Äòwait and see‚Äô stage. How the graphs look as movement levels keep rising back towards normality will be very interesting,‚Äù he says.
Second wave
The virus would have difficulty reestablishing itself in the community if a significant portion of people, between 50% and 70%, were infected and are now immune, says Leung. But he notes that even in Wuhan ‚Äî which accounted for more than half China‚Äôs 81,000 cases ‚Äî the number of those people infected and are now immune to the disease is probably less than 10% ‚Äî which means there are lots of people still vulnerable to infection. A vaccine would increase the percentage of immune people, but no vaccines are expected for at least a year. ‚ÄúThese numbers don‚Äôt allow a sigh of relief,‚Äù he says.
Covert coronavirus infections could be seeding new outbreaks
To see the risk of easing these measures, ‚ÄúYou only have to look across to Hong Kong to see what‚Äôs happened there with a resurgence,‚Äù says Tatem. Hong Kong, as well as Singapore and Taiwan, contained the initial spread of the coronavirus with intensive testing and contract tracing.
But over the last week, all three regions have seen a jump in new infections. Most were in travellers from abroad, but some local transmission has been detected. All three regions have now temporarily banned international visitors and are making returning residents undergo a two-week quarantine.
Containment measures should be relaxed ‚Äúgradually and with ultra-caution and very close monitoring and surveillance‚Äù, says Tatem.
Test and trace
China is still implementing extensive COVID-19 monitoring nationwide. Provinces issue all residents a QR code, a type of barcode containing information that is revealed when scanned, based on their health details and travel history. If a person has remained in areas considered safe in China or has been quarantined and tested negative for the disease, they are assigned a ‚Äògreen status‚Äô ‚Äî the lowest risk ‚Äî which allows them to cross provincial borders, enter hospitals and residential areas, and ride the subway and trains.
The measure not only keeps infected people from mingling with others, but if a new infection is detected, the government can track that person‚Äôs movements and pinpoint people they might have come in contact with. Cowling calls this an ‚Äúadvanced form of test and trace‚Äù that will allow China to identify as many infected people as possible as quickly as possible, and then isolate them.
The big question is whether that will be enough to stop a new outbreak. Cowling thinks other cities would have trouble if required to do the number of tests that Wuhan did, which at its peak reached about 10,000 tests per day. ‚ÄúThere is a danger in focusing too much on testing and isolation,‚Äù he says, and adds that social-distancing measures will still be important.
How pandemics shape social evolution
Chinese cities seem to fear the dangers of loosening measures to keep people apart too soon. Museums and attractions in Shanghai, which have been open for the past 18 days, were shut again from today. Cinemas were also closed again. Although the city has relaxed some rules: people are no longer required to have a pass to leave residential compounds, and delivery people are able to enter these areas. The city also dropped the requirement to wear masks in some public areas ‚Äî a practice police had previously enforced with drones or robots.
Most of the countries now facing raging outbreaks, including Italy, Spain and the United States, are relying on social-distancing policies and getting people to stay home. China implemented those measures, but it also built new hospitals and conducted extensive testing. Then, officials went door to door to check people‚Äôs temperatures. They tested anyone with a fever, and isolated positive cases. ‚ÄúThe extra work allowed them to stop the virus,‚Äù says Cowling. ‚ÄúPeople are following China, but not in exactly the same way,‚Äù he says.",['David Cyranoski'],2020-03-30 00:00:00

Public health experts say social distancing appears to be working, and letting up these measures too soon could be disastrous. Until there is a sustained reduction in new cases ‚Äî and the coronavirus' spread is clearly slowing ‚Äî we need to stay the course.
Still, society can't stay shut down forever. Public health and state leaders are starting to talk about how and when to relax social distancing guidelines, and President Trump is expected to soon announce finalized guidelines to help states make those decisions. Even then, it's clear that life won't go back to normal all at once. The decisions will be staggered, and a lot of it will come down to local and regional circumstances.
""We have to do it strategically and safely,"" said Dr. Monica Bharel, commissioner of the Massachusetts Department of Public Health, at a briefing by the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials Wednesday. ""The worst possible outcome of reopening public life would be a second wave of this pandemic.""
Support comes from
Public health leaders agree that in order to safely lift social distancing restrictions we must create and sustain systems that can rapidly stamp out any new coronavirus flare-ups so they don't spiral out of control. Here are five key things health experts say must be addressed as we begin to start businesses and community life up again.
1. Improve rapid testing
Among public health leaders, the mantra for stopping coronavirus from surging is ""test, trace and isolate."" Widespread testing with fast results is the first step ‚Äî if we don't have enough tests, we don't know where the virus is spreading. This has been a major sticking point in the U.S. response to the coronavirus, though progress has been made.
A test that provides results in less than 15 minutes is now available in some hospitals and doctor's offices. The company that produces it, Abbott, says it is able to provide about 50,000 tests per day. It runs on the same platform that doctors use to do quick, in-office strep or flu tests.
Dr. Rachel Levine, Pennsylvania's secretary of health, said these types of quick tests will be ""really critical"" to broaden access to testing, but so far her state has had trouble getting them. ""We have to make sure that [there is] access in vulnerable communities,"" particularly for members of Hispanic and African American communities, she said.
Nationally, there are more than 120,000 COVID-19 tests being done every day, but experts say we need to continue to ramp this up. ""You want to be doing [tests] at mass scale,"" says Dr. Scott Gottlieb, former head of the Food and Drug Administration, who has developed a road map to reopening at the American Enterprise Institute. He says that could mean doing several million tests every week.
One big challenge labs have had in scaling up testing has been shortages of supplies, such as swabs to collect the samples, special fluids needed to safely transport them, and reagent chemicals to extract and analyze the genetic material from the virus. Labs around the U.S. and around the world are competing for these same supplies as demand surges globally.
Reliable serological tests ‚Äî also known as antibody tests ‚Äî are also key to getting a handle on how much of a community's population has already been exposed to the virus. Once someone has been exposed to the virus, their blood contains antibodies made by their immune system to fend off the infection. Serological blood tests, which can be performed quickly with a prick blood-draw, can detect these.
Several of these tests have been developed, but it's not yet clear how reliable they are and it's a big effort to scale up availability. ""This is really a late summer, early fall kind of endeavor ‚Äî these tools probably aren't going to all be fully deployed in time to help us get out of the current epidemic,"" Gottlieb says.
2. Massively upgrade contact tracing capacity
The next step in ""test, trace, isolate"" is ""trace"" ‚Äî a shorthand for contact tracing. By tracking and communicating with the contacts of a confirmed COVID-19 case who are themselves at risk for infection, health workers can dramatically slow the chain of transmission.
It's a labor-intensive process and the U.S. currently lacks the workforce to do this nationally. The head of the CDC told NPR last week that the agency is working on a big plan to scale up the workforce, though the details have yet to be released. An analysis by the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security found the country may need 100,000 contact tracers, which would cost an estimated $3.6 billion. Dr. Tom Frieden, a former director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, estimates the country may need even more, on the order of 300,000.
States are scrambling to ramp up contact tracing now. ""We will need to beef up our workforce,"" said Levine, the Pennsylvania health secretary. She said her state will hire more people and may use volunteers, too.
Health officials from other states agreed about the urgent need to expand contact investigations. ""The capacity has been essentially overwhelmed,"" says John Wiesman, the secretary of health for Washington state. ""We need to redouble and triple efforts here around the pieces of case and contact investigation.""
The push to expand contract tracing quickly may go high-tech. Google and Apple are collaborating on a new system to develop apps for contact tracing, similar to those used in places like Singapore. There are privacy concerns with using smartphones to track people's movements and contacts, and these apps are still in development, so even this shortcut will still take some time.
3. Create systems to isolate the sick and protect the vulnerable
Once the contacts of COVID-19 patients are traced, many will need to separate themselves from society for two weeks to be sure they are not infectious. There needs to be a support structure in place to make that possible, says Dr. Harvey Fineberg, a health policy researcher at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.
""Part of a complete strategy for quarantine is that you provide places apart from the home and community where those who've been exposed can ‚Äî in a comfortable setting ‚Äî spend the time of their quarantine where they are not going to infect others,"" he says.
This approach has been used in countries like China and South Korea where the coronavirus appears to be largely under control. Fineberg says it could be important for those who don't have the space or resources to separate themselves safely from their household. ""We have empty hotels all over America,"" he adds.
Hotels have started to be offered as housing for health care workers concerned about infecting their family members but, Fineberg says, there is not currently a national plan to roll out quarantine centers more broadly.
Frieden, the former CDC director, agrees that places like hotels and dorm rooms may need to be part of America's effort to get a handle on the coronavirus. ""We need to think of this as an all of society response,"" he says. ""The countries that have had the best results, they've tested huge numbers of patients, and they've isolated patients not just in their own home, but in special facilities for people who don't need hospitalization but don't want to spread it to their family members.""
This kind of approach could be especially important for anyone who lives in close quarters with a lot of people ‚Äî for instance, those in long-term care facilities, prisons or nursing homes.
""Ground zero for COVID-19 in this country is nursing homes,"" says Frieden. ""When COVID gets into a nursing home, it can really cause devastation. We need to do everything possible to stop spread in congregate facilities like nursing homes.""
Homeless shelters are a concern as well. Officials in Washington state, California and New York City have already started to use hotels and motels to house homeless residents who live in coronavirus hotspots.
4. Build up hospital capacity and the PPE supply chain
Hospitals have been scrambling to be able to handle more and more COVID-19 patients, but there's still work to be done to make sure they're ready for possible new waves of infections.
""It's a certainty that cases will increase when you relax social distancing,"" says Dr. Amesh Adalja of the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. ""It's just: Will it be at a slow enough clip that hospital capacity will not be compromised?""
Hospitals are still struggling to source many essential supplies to allow them to serve a surge of patients. There's regional variation, but the AEI road map suggests that, on average, hospitals need to double their intensive care unit and ventilator capacity to care for critically ill COVID-19 patients, and that the supply of personal protective equipment should be stable so health care workers can protect themselves from infection.
Adalja is encouraged by efforts by hospitals and communities to share resources with each other, so that limited equipment can be targeted to the right places. He said that progress has already been made in ""being able to rapidly move ventilators from one part of a country to another part of the country as the need arises."" A public-private partnership called the ""Dynamic Ventilator Reserve,"" announced on Tuesday, aims to facilitate this kind of coordination between hospitals across the country.
5. Zero in on effective treatments
At the moment there's no clear evidence on an effective therapy for COVID-19. Right now, it's a waiting game as data on various treatments start to roll in.
The Milken Institute is tracking dozens of different clinical trials underway to test treatments. Researchers are testing everything from antibody-based therapies to antiviral medicines, as well as existing drugs including hydroxychloroquine that could be repurposed to help treat COVID-19. It's too soon to say if drugs such as the antiviral remdesivir, are effective, but the company behind this drug says it will have some preliminary results from a study at the end of April.
""Maybe in weeks or months, we may start to get some data from some of the experimental drugs to see how well they work,"" says Adalja. ""But truly, unequivocally effective antiviral treatment may take some time to develop."" A simple pill to treat coronavirus outside of a hospital, like Tamiflu for influenza, is even further out, he says.
Gottlieb says the combination of effective treatments as well as expanded testing and surveillance would put us in a situation where we can live with the virus, instead of being paralyzed by it.
""I think that [would be] a robust enough set of tools that this could become a livable threat, that we can get back to a fairly normal way of life and be able to mitigate the risk from coronavirus even before we have a vaccine in place,"" he says. ""Now, life will never be perfectly the same until we have a vaccine that can fully vanquish it.""
There are dozens of compounds being evaluated for the development of a vaccine, but that's at least a year off.

The Spanish government are already beginning to prepare a plan for the future as the country looks to gradually return to normal, once the coronavirus pandemic passes.
The government are working on a total resumption of activity and employment in two phases. The first one would be for the productive sectors and work, which would be from this summer; and the second one, from the end of the year.
The Minister of Labour, Yolanda Diaz, explained that measures for the country's reactivation are being considered in two periods and warned that the most affected sectors, such as tourism and leisure, will be extended until the end of 2020.
""One that will cover the productive sectors until the summer and another that will extend until the end of the year and that would affect sectors such as tourism, culture or leisure,"" she said.
The return to normalcy - i.e. our lives before the pandemic - is not expected until Christmas.
Sectors such as tourism, culture, catering and air and sea transport ""are going to have enormous difficulties,"" the Minister admitted.
The return to normalcy in bars, restaurants, hotels, concerts, theatres or cinemas is expected to be slower.
Diaz has made it clear that the final decision on the return to the activity corresponds to the Ministry of Health, who will decide these issues when the situation regarding COVID-19 is under control and does not exert a risk of further contagion.",[],2020-04-18 15:00:14

222,febbf841-0b15-4faa-b1ca-b4ad7a4c720f,lapido,https://theconversation.com/european-union-are-borders-the-antidote-to-the-covid-19-pandemic-136643,European Union: are borders the antidote to the Covid-19 pandemic?,"In 1588, Montaigne, recounting his journey across Europe, describes his physical and metaphysical concerns in a time of plague. The only real borders then in Europe were those formed by nature: a hill, a river, etc. There were also walls, serving as protective belts. The plague formed a much more formidable border, barring access to the infected city and inspiring fear of quarantine, a curative confinement.
‚ÄúHere is yet another misfortune: outdoors and indoors, I was beset by the plague, the most violent plague of them all. [‚Ä¶] I have to endure this bizarre situation: the very view of my home has become frightful. [‚Ä¶] And the worst thing is that, according to the rules of medicine, for every potential danger, you are required to remain forty days in thrall to uncertainty ‚Äì the imagination torments you at will, making you feverish, despite your good health.‚Äù (Essays, III, Chap. III)
While the time of the plague has long since passed, the coronavirus Covid-19 makes us ask once again if the border should be viewed as a protective shield. Is it still such a ‚Äúbad good idea‚Äù to erect borders against the spread of this new and currently untreatable disease?
S√©bastien Bozon/AFP
The European Union and borders: saying the unsaid
Europe is built on the utopian idea of abolishing borders; it has continually strived for their gradual devaluation. Crossing a European border no longer involves long waits and fastidious, arbitrary searches. But now the EU has to redefine the function of borders. In 2019 it already considered its external borders protective filters for goods arriving from outside the EU. Now it must define these borders differently: as a health and safety mechanism of the utmost importance. In this regard, the EU has been overtaken by its member states, who were quick to order the closure of their national borders as the threat of Covid-19 became clear.
From the constitutional perspective, there‚Äôs nothing unreasonable about member states taking responsibility for public health and protecting their populations. This has always been their responsibility within the EU. The intersection of health care and freedom of movement has been an issue since the Treaty of Rome in 1957. When the concern is for the health of the population, member states have always been allowed to control who crosses their borders. For example, article 45 of the Treaty of Lisbon, in force since 2009, provides that the free movement of workers can be limited for reasons of public health. Article 29 of directive 2004/38 provides an exception to freedom of movement, and the possibility of expulsion, for carriers of potentially epidemic diseases or contagious parasites. It also establishes a mechanism authorising member states to demand medical certificates from those wishing to visit or work within their territory.
The Court of Justice of the European Union, based in Luxembourg and charged with interpreting EU law, agrees that member states should have responsibility for public health matters. The Member State, in its view, should decide on both the level of health protection and any measures put in place.
When it comes to combating the novel coronavirus, this permits the closure (or non-closure) of borders, the confinement (or non-confinement) of the population, or obliging (or not obliging) the population to wear masks and undergo tests. These measures can all be justified as long as the aim is to to protect public health. The EU Court of Justice tries to ascertain, in each case, whether less stringent (though no less effective) measures can be put in place by member states to achieve the same ends.
Are border closures an effective way to protect public health? This question is undoubtedly going to arise in a national or European courtroom. In any case, there is a certain proportionality in how the borders have been enforced ‚Äì for example, cross-border workers are still allowed to cross the closed borders.
Miguel Medina/AFP
What do member states aim to achieve by closing their borders?
On 16 March 2020, the European Commission published a communication on border management during the Covid-19 epidemic. This is a long way from the ‚Äúreligion of open borders‚Äù denounced by Marine Le Pen. The communication reminds member states of their responsibilities in matters of public health, and provides guidelines for proportionate management of national borders. In case of ‚Äúextremely critical situations‚Äù, member states can temporarily reintroduce internal border controls. This had already been experimented with in the Schengen Area during the migrant crisis of 2015, and the terrorist attacks of the same year. Once again, nations must reassume control of their borders in order to protect the health and safety of their populations.
For the Commission, the national border becomes a filter preventing those who appear sick to cross and become vectors of contagion. This doesn‚Äôt mean closing the border and turning away the sick, but rather providing non-discriminatory care and isolation in the country of entry. This provides a legal basis for the quarantining of people arriving from sites of infection. member states cannot use borders to make travel more difficult or discourage movement, if only because the creation of bottle-necks is highly conducive to the spread of contagion.
What does it mean to close the border?
The closure of borders cannot merely be declared by the Member State like a mantra, a magic word to dispel the virus. It can only be effective if borders become sites of reinforced controls serving to limit the spread of infection. In any case, the Commission does not talk about closing national borders, but rather specific measures for when they are crossed.
In order for these measures to be effective, careful coordination is required. Strengthening checks on people crossing the border between Austria and Italy, or halting a train, does nothing to combat a health crisis if no further measures are taken in either Italy or Austria. In other words, member states cannot just hunker down behind their borders and trust in their protective functions.
During his first televised address on 12 March, Emmanuel Macron explained:
‚Äú[There will] undoubtedly be control measures, border closures, but these measures must be taken as Europeans, at the European level, because it‚Äôs at this level that we‚Äôve constructed our freedoms and protections.‚Äù
In this regard, the European Union wants to give substance to the principle of solidarity between member states. It prioritises increasingly systematic coordination between member states by videoconference, but also, above all, by means of measures for managing the unprecedented health crisis. Some will say that these are ‚Äúmeasurettes‚Äù, and that the EU is only showing its ineffectiveness. In reality, something deeper is at work.
Gert Eggenberger/AFP
But what is the European Union doing?
Many doctors on the front line in the battle against the coronavirus were quickly moved to anger by the absence of any ‚ÄúEuropean health care‚Äù. It is true that the EU has no legal capacity to promote uniform measures to fight the coronavirus.
In the sharing of power between the EU and its member states, the member states take the reins when it comes to the protection of public health. The EU has jurisdiction over the harmonisation of national regulations, essentially guaranteeing the quality of medication. The EU can take action, but only as a ‚Äúsupporting competence‚Äù: that is, acting to ‚Äúsupport, coordinate or supplement the actions of the member states‚Äù in matters of public health.
The current crisis makes clear why a coordinated policy is in fact preferable to a uniform policy. member states‚Äô responses to the same crisis vary greatly, because the outbreak is different in each country (the degree of infection, hospital capacity, etc). There are even regional differences within individual member states: for example, sections of the border in Germany were closed (between Bade-W√ºrttemberg and Alsace), while others remain open (between North Rhine-Westphalia and Belgium for example).
From these differences we can conclude that a uniform European solution is neither legally feasible nor objectively desirable. But this doesn‚Äôt mean that Europe is not taking action.
Patrick Hertzog/AFP
Deploying a range of EU policies
The EU acts beyond health policy, first and foremost to provide member states with the means to confront the major economic crisis which will follow the health crisis. It is an unprecedented situation for whole sections of the economy to be put on hold, and for so many citizens to be placed under quarantine.
The European Commission is mobilising commissioners to coordinate a response to the crisis: along with president Ursula von der Leyen are seven commissioners focused on economic issues (executive vice-president Vestager and commissioners Breton, Gentiloni and Valean), health (commissioner Kyriakidou), borders (Johannson), and crisis management (Lenarƒçiƒç). The Commission is also taking some unprecedented measures, such as suspending the stability and growth pact, allowing member states to accumulate public debt and inject liquidities into the national economy.
The European Central Bank has also played its part by freeing up 1050 billion euro (after an initial effort that was judged too conservative).
The EU‚Äôs external border controls become a political issue
The EU is not closing its borders, but rather transforming them into areas safeguarding European public health. Essential to this new discourse, and constituting a remarkable change, is the systematic control of every person entering the EU via its external borders. The borders are now ‚Äúviscous‚Äù, so that infected people can be caught and isolated. Information is coordinated between member states. The free movement of information can also be seen in the search for a treatment for Covid-19.
But while borders become filters for potentially infected people, they should still remain open for goods: freedom of movement is an urgent necessity when it comes to respirators, masks and medication. For similar reasons, member states can still allow the sick to be transported across borders, for example when hospitals are overcrowded ‚Äì as is the case with Bade-W√ºrttenberg receiving patients from Mulhouse.
S√©bastien Bozon/AFP
Can we live without the internal market?
During his address on March 12, Emmanuel Macron claimed that ‚Äúwhat this pandemic reveals is that there are goods and services which should be raised above the laws of the market‚Äù. This is a highly charged formula. The internal market will never be the same after Covid-19. The lack of a convincing response from liberalism (and the somewhat more effective response from the authoritarian regime in China) suggests that it may be time for systemic change, taking into consideration the negative consequences of ‚Äúfull globalisation‚Äù.
When it comes to public health, the EU needs to find the resources to produce its own vital medicines, protective masks and respirators. In spite of everything, the internal market remains a necessity in this new world, because the virus goes beyond the local and even the national. Perhaps the coronavirus has managed to make European sovereignty a reality at last‚Ä¶

For the two to thrive in various situations, Information seeking and sending must be prioritised. The priority, however, should not overcome verification of sources such as individuals or organisations before devouring the information.
In a crisis like disease outbreaks, people are more curious and eager to know specific information about the disease. Such information might include possible strategies and tactics for containment, treatment and vaccines or drugs. The report of Coronavirus in Wuhan, China, has changed people‚Äôs ways of seeking knowledge about health-related issues or needs in that last few months.
Various sources have been used for seeking and disseminating information about the virus. Medical experts, public affairs analysts and social commentators still believe that post-COVID-19 would strengthen the use of sources such as social networking sites and interpersonal channel by the people to express what they think, feel or experiment about different diseases as long as the media increase their attention through news to the diseases.
For instance, a recent study shows that people respond to the first report of COVID-19 by immediately seeking information about COVID-19. The study notes that they searched coronavirus, coronavirus symptoms and hand sanitizer using the Internet. This is not quite different from what happened in Nigeria on February 27, 2020. Immediately, the National Centre for Disease Control and the Lagos State Government announced the first index case in Nigeria, people‚Äôs attention shifted to understanding of the virus and how they could protect themselves from contracting it on February 28, 2020, a day after the announcement of the case.
Searching Symptoms Information
As at April 18, over 500 cases have been recorded, while more than 100 people have recovered. The trend is not limiting the people‚Äôs knowledge seeking about the virus through the Internet, especially among the people who access the Internet through mobile phone. In its latest report, the National Bureau of Statistics notes that ‚Äúa total of 126,078,999 subscribers were active on internet as against 123,163,027 in Q3 2019 and 112,065,740 in Q4 2018. This represented 2.37% growth in internet subscriptions Quarter on Quarter and 12.50% Year on Year. Lagos State has the highest number of subscribers in terms of active internet per State in Q4 2019 and closely followed by Kano and Ogun States respectively, while Bayelsa and Ebonyi States have the least number of subscribers.‚Äù
With these data, our analyst believes the subscribers must have searched specific information about the virus from February 27 to April 17, 2020. This is 33 days. According to the NBS, the total number of Internet users as at Q4, 2019 is 126,078,999. Using percent of normalised searches (0-100 threshold), we determined samples of the Internet users who sought knowledge about coronavirus symptoms between February 27 and April 17, 2020 [see Exhibit 1]. Our sample is 73,408,452. Out of this, we found 1.82% of the samples as the users who searched for coronavirus symptoms during the period. This represents a total of 1,336,033 people in 33 days [see Exhibit 2].
Exhibit 1: Coronavirus Symptoms Search per State
This is not encouraging considering the number of the Internet users (through mobile phones) per state, according to the NBS. Further analysis shows that the interest in coronavirus symptoms, confirmed cases and deaths grew at different degree of measurement. Our analysis establishes that the public interest in coronavirus symptoms and deaths followed the linear growth pattern, while confirmed cased grew exponentially. Our analysis suggests 20.7% linkage of interest in coronavirus symptoms with the examined 33 days. This implies that in each day, at least one search interest about coronavirus facilitated interest in coronavirus symptoms by 20.7%. It was 21.7% for deaths, indicating that report of death by the concerned authorities ensured public interest in coronavirus symptoms by 21.7% each day [see Exhibit 3 and 4].
Exhibit 3: Linear and Exponential Growths of Cases and Public Interest in Symptoms of the Virus
Exhibit 4: Linear Growth of Deaths and Public Interest in Symptoms of the Virus
Going Forward
During this period, our analysis suggests 5.6% growth in the number of cases with the implication that about 49 cases could be recorded from an infected person in the next 21 days. The insights from this piece indicate that concerned stakeholders, most especially the National Centre for Disease Control and National Orientation Agency need to intensify efforts on the containment of the virus through strategic public enlightenment messages. It is also important that contact tracing effort increases, while social distancing and lockdown approaches should not be abandoned by the government at state and federal levels.

Results: Statistically significant correlations are observed between online interest and COVID-19 cases and deaths. Furthermore, a critical point, after which the Pearson correlation coefficient starts declining (even if it is still statistically significant) was identified, indicating that this method is most efficient in regions or countries that have not yet peaked in COVID-19 cases.
Methods: Time series from Google Trends from January to March 2020 on the Topic (Virus) of ‚ÄúCoronavirus‚Äù were retrieved and correlated with official data on COVID-19 cases and deaths worldwide and in the European countries that have been affected the most: Italy (at national and regional level), Spain, France, Germany, and the United Kingdom.
Objective: In light of the recent coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic that started in Wuhan, China in 2019, online search traffic data from Google are used to track the spread of the new coronavirus disease in Europe.
Introduction
In December 2019, Chinese researchers identified a novel coronavirus in humans that caused acute respiratory syndrome‚Äîofficially called coronavirus disease (COVID-19) as of February 11, 2020 [ ]. China reported its first death on January 11, 2020, and Wuhan in the Hubei province, which was identified as the epicenter of the epidemic, was cut off by Chinese authorities on January 23, 2020 [ ].
COVID-19 quickly surpassed the death toll of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) pandemic on February 9, 2020 [ ]. The virus had already spread to several other Chinese regions, quickly affecting many neighboring countries as well, like the Philippines and South Korea [ ]. Several cases of COVID-19 were reported throughout Europe over the next days without causing any regional epidemic at the time; although this did not last long, with Italy having its first death on February 21, 2020 [ ], which in a short time spread to all European countries, resulting in the World Health Organization declaring it a pandemic on March 11, 2020 [ ].
As of March 25, 2020, COVID-19 cases have surpassed 471,000 worldwide, with more than 335,000 still active, and with more than 21,000 deaths. The country with the most confirmed COVID-19 cases is the United States with 81,864, almost half of which are in the state of New York. Italy is the most affected country in number of deaths as of March 25, with 74,386 cases and 7503 deaths. Lombardy, the origin of the Italy epidemic, is the most affected region, followed by Emilia-Romagna, Veneto, Piedmont, Marche, Tuscany, and Liguria. In Europe, Spain is unfortunately following Italy‚Äôs curve, with 49,515 cases and 3647 deaths. Both countries have surpassed China‚Äôs 3287 reported COVID-19 death toll. France and Germany are also facing a difficult situation, with more than 29,155 and 43,646 confirmed cases, respectively. All European countries have COVID-19 cases, and most countries have at least one death. However, there is a clear geographical distribution of COVID-19 cases in Europe, with central and southwest Europe being the most affected. depicts the current situation in COVID-19 cases worldwide up to March 25, 2020, while shows the COVID-19 (total cumulative, not per capita) deaths by country up to March 25, 2020. All data on COVID-19 cases and deaths were retrieved from Worldometer [ ].

Italy is the first country facing serious issues and a large number of deaths due to COVID-19 in Europe, followed by Spain, France, Germany, and the United Kingdom [ ]. The main issue in all affected countries is that of the health systems‚Äô capabilities and performance. Toward this direction and based on early Italian data about the spread of the disease, all European countries have taken measures aiming at ‚Äúflattening the curve‚Äù [ ], meaning to spread the cases‚Äîand, consequently, the patients that need to be admitted to the intensive care unit‚Äîover a longer period of time.
Said measures mainly consist of flight restrictions, borders closing, shutting down cafes and restaurants, closing of schools, and self-isolation at first and restriction of movement afterwards, with a total lockdown being the last resort, which has unfortunately been taken in several cases, like that of Lombardy and Spain. The United Kingdom and the Netherlands followed a different approach at first, despite the Imperial College‚Äôs Response Team‚Äôs reports led by Prof Ferguson [ - ], with many claiming that they were aiming at herd immunity, which also posed several ethical concerns. Even these two countries, however, resorted to some measures and restrictions at the end [ , ].
As Gunther Eysenbach, who first proposed the concept of infodemiology (ie, information epidemiology [ - ]), suggested during the SARS pandemic, the use of population health technologies such as the internet can assist with the detection of diseases during an early stage [ ]. Given the serious impact of the novel coronavirus and toward the direction of using new methods and approaches for the nowcasting and forecasting of this pandemic, in this paper, Google Trends data are used to explore the relationship between online interest in COVID-19 and cases and deaths in severely affected European countries (ie, Italy, Spain, France, Germany, and the United Kingdom). During these times, infodemiology metrics, especially if combined with traditional data, can be an integral part of the surveillance of the virus at the regional level.
Methods
Data from Google Trends [ ] are normalized and retrieved online in .csv format. Note that data may slightly vary based on the time of retrieval. Time series from Google Trends for various time intervals from January to March 2020 on the Topic (Virus) of ‚ÄúCoronavirus‚Äù are used, combined with official data on COVID-19 cases and deaths retrieved from Worldometer [ ]. The aim is to track the spread of the disease in the European countries that have been affected the most (ie, Italy, Spain, France, Germany, and the United Kingdom). Regional analysis is performed in Italy (data from the Ministry of Health [ ]), and the Pearson correlation coefficients between COVID-19 cases and deaths and Google Trends time series are calculated. The Topic of ‚ÄúCoronavirus‚Äù was selected instead of the ‚ÄúCOVID-19‚Äù search term, as the latter was not widely used up to the point of the analysis.
For the general worldwide interest and correlation analysis, the period was set from January 22 to March 17, 2020, while for the rest of the European countries it was set from February 15 to March 17. For the detailed European countries‚Äô correlation analysis, case and death data from March 2 to 17 were used. A new data set was retrieved for each time frame, which matched the official COVID-19 case data. The default ‚ÄúAll categories‚Äù and ‚ÄúWeb search‚Äù were selected. Note that each country, region, and county were examined individually, and no comparisons between countries in COVID-19 data or Google data were made. The heat maps are based on absolute numbers for COVID-19 cases and deaths, and not according to the respective population. The methodology was designed based on the Google Trends methodology framework in infodemiology and infoveillance [ ].
Results

The most effective factors besides previous day incidence included the search frequency of handwashing, hand sanitizer, and antiseptic topics. The RMSE of the LSTM model was 27.187 (SD 20.705).
Methods: Data were obtained from the Google Trends website. Linear regression and long short-term memory (LSTM) models were used to estimate the number of positive COVID-19 cases. All models were evaluated using 10-fold cross-validation, and root mean square error (RMSE) was used as the performance metric.
Background: The recent global outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is affecting many countries worldwide. Iran is one of the top 10 most affected countries. Search engines provide useful data from populations, and these data might be useful to analyze epidemics. Utilizing data mining methods on electronic resources‚Äô data might provide a better insight into the COVID-19 outbreak to manage the health crisis in each country and worldwide.
Introduction
Recently, a respiratory disease originating from coronavirus occurred in Wuhan City of China. Since the first positive case of this virus was in 2019, this coronavirus was named coronavirus disease (COVID-19) by the World Health Organization (WHO) [ ]. Some hypotheses attribute the origin of this virus to seafood and bats [ ].
COVID-19 has spread globally and has affected most countries; it was defined as a pandemic by the WHO in March 2020 [ ]. As of March 21, 2020, COVID-19 has affected 186 countries and territories around the world, with more than 280,000 confirmed cases and 11,842 deaths [ ]. Iran is one of the top 10 countries affected by this virus [ ].
As COVID-19 is spreading rapidly worldwide, prediction models can help in health resource management and planning for prevention purposes. Google search data is one information resource that contains useful information to predict and estimate epidemics [ ]. Data mining algorithms and techniques are well-known tools for predictive model development and data analysis. They can implicitly extract useful information from raw data [ - ]. The extracted knowledge can be used in different areas such as the health care industry. Recently, a large amount of data was generated in health care, including those on patients, diseases, and diagnoses.
The tasks in data mining fall into two categories: (1) descriptive tasks that deal with the general properties of the data and (2) predictive tasks, wherein the goal is to build models that can estimate the mapping from inputs to outputs by using a sample of data called training data. The trained models can be deployed to make predictions of the outputs for unseen inputs. These techniques are more flexible and efficient for exploratory analysis than the traditional statistical analysis [ ].
In this study, data mining models were used to build predictive models from Google search data to predict the incidence of COVID-19 in Iran.
Methods
Dataset
The daily new cases of coronavirus (daily incidence) from February 15, 2020, to March 18, 2020, in Iran were obtained from the Worldometer website [ ].
Google Trends [ ] was searched for concepts related to COVID-19, from February 10, 2020, to March 18, 2020. The related concepts were suggested by one of the authors. A dataset consisting of 10 input features including the previous day‚Äôs search trends, cases of the previous day, and a target value (new cases of that day) was created. The total number of entries was calculated for the 37 days. The list of features is shown in . The terms in square brackets were searched in the corresponding Persian language words. The ‚Äúpd‚Äù postfix in the features‚Äô name indicates that the features are related to the previous day.
Google Trends does not provide absolute search numbers but instead, provides a measure entitled interest over time, which is described as ‚ÄúA value of 100 is the peak popularity for the term. A value of 50 means that the term is half as popular. A score of 0 means there was not enough data for this term‚Äù [ ]; for consistency, the values of the daily new cases were transformed to the range between 0 to 100.

Modeling and Evaluation
Linear Regression
One of the data mining techniques used for prediction tasks is linear regression. In a problem with one predictor, this technique tries to find the best line to fit. That line could relate the predictor and prediction values. The extended version of this one-predictor regression is called multiple linear regression and is used for multiple-predictor problems [ ]. We used this type of linear regression in this study.
Long Short-Term Memory
Long short-term memory (LSTM) is an artificial recurrent neural network that is an effective model for the prediction of time series where data are sequential [ ]. By storing the past in hidden states, they can predict the outputs more accurately. In this study, the aim was to estimate the number of positive COVID-19 cases through time; as this is a well-suited task for the LSTM model, we used this model in our study.
The linear regression model and a 3-layer LSTM model ( ) are employed to predict the daily new cases. RapidMiner Studio 9.3.001 (RapidMiner GmbH) and Python 3.7.3 (Python Software Foundation) were used for modeling and evaluation. Tensorflow (Google Brain Team) and Keras (Fran√ßois Cholle) were used as frameworks for training LSTM models. In addition, 10-fold cross-validation was used to evaluate the performance of the models, and the root mean square error (RMSE) metric was chosen for performance evaluation:
Results
The features‚Äô effect in the linear regression model is shown in . The RMSE for the linear regression model was 7.562 (SD 6.492). The LSTM RMSE was 27.187 (SD 20.705). The training and validation loss of the LSTM model is shown in . The predictions made by these models are shown in .

With over 2 billion users, YouTube is a media channel that millions turn to when seeking information.
Introduction
In December 2019, several cases of pneumonia of an unknown etiology were reported in Wuhan, China [ ]. On January 20, 2020, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) as well as state and local health departments began monitoring the burgeoning situation [ ]. By the end of January, the World Health Organization (WHO) had declared the outbreak to be of serious concern [ ]. The disease, now known as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was officially named by WHO on February 11, 2020 [ ]. By March 7, 2020, the global number of reported cases had surpassed 100,000 [ ].
As a novel global health threat, the scientific community has only begun to investigate the distinguishing features of COVID-19. Epidemiological and biomedical research thus far suggests the following. The incubation period ranges from 1-14 days [ ]. COVID-19 is largely spread by contact with respiratory droplets from an infected individual. Symptoms most commonly include fever, fatigue, and a dry cough [ ]. The Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention reports from mid-February indicated a case fatality rate of 2.3% and that 81% of cases were mild in nature [ ]. It is understood that the case fatality rate will shift as more cases are identified. However, it also became clear that COVID-19 is substantially deadlier than seasonal influenza [ ]. The risk of severe illness and death appears to be concentrated among older populations and those with underlying medical conditions [ ].
It is unclear how long SARS-CoV-2 survives on surfaces, but estimates suggest anywhere from a few hours to several days [ ]. Community spread has been reported worldwide [ ], and on March 11, 2020, the WHO declared COVID-19 a pandemic [ ]. Testing in the United States was delayed in late February and March, hampering case identification efforts [ ]. Testing may have been hindered initially by not only a lack of tests but also out-of-pocket costs for those uninsured or underinsured [ ]; on March 5, 2020, America‚Äôs Health Plans indicated they would waive copays for COVID-19 testing. Containment is complicated by the fact that substantial numbers of Americans lack paid sick leave [ ], and, as of March 13, 2020, public schools in densely populated urban areas such as New York continued to remain open. Projections of widespread transmission indicate that health care systems may rapidly become overwhelmed [ ]. There are no specific treatments for the virus at present [ ]. Concerns over COVID-19 have had a swift impact on global financial markets with potential long-term repercussions on a number of sectors [ ]. As with SARS-CoV, a number of news outlets have reported a swift uptick in anti-Asian racism [ - ]. In some areas, public fears about COVID-19 have led to panic buying of supplies including personal protective equipment, reducing the availability of necessary supplies for health care workers [ ].
One of the most important aspects of an effective campaign to minimize COVID-19 transmission is accurate information that is conveyed in a way that is understood by the public. Google Trends demonstrates a substantial spike in interest in COVID-19 since early February 2020 [ ], and the WHO has characterized the exponential increase in information (and misinformation) about COVID-19 as an ‚Äúinfodemic‚Äù [ ]. The CDC and WHO have steadily been posting content discoverable on the internet. Moreover, the WHO has been working with social media outlets to ensure users searching for information on COVID-19 are guided to reliable sources [ ]. Despite these efforts, in novel and rapidly evolving situations, there is a high potential for misinformation and disinformation to spread through online sources [ , ]. As the second most popular social media platform after Google [ ] and with over 2 billion users [ ], YouTube is a media channel that millions turn to when seeking information on COVID-19. Even videos that cover COVID-19 in a particular national context likely have a global reach. Although previous investigations have examined the content of YouTube videos on infectious diseases such as Ebola [ , ], H1N1 influenza [ , ], West Nile virus [ ], and Zika virus [ ], we did not identify any published studies that have investigated the content of YouTube videos related to COVID-19. This study, therefore, aimed to address this gap in current knowledge.
Methods
The sample of videos was delimited to the 100 most widely viewed YouTube videos uploaded throughout the month of January 2020. The keyword ‚ÄúCoronavirus‚Äù was used as the search term, which was the most widely used terminology to describe COVID-19 at that time. The videos were sorted by view count to identify the 100 most widely viewed videos (in both English, including subtitles, and Spanish). There were 7 videos excluded and replaced: 5 for irrelevance (not about the virus) and 2 because they were in a language other than English or Spanish.
Coding categories ( ) were created using a CDC fact sheet on COVID-19 [ , ] and prior YouTube studies on Ebola and Zika [ , ]. Content was classified into 5 categories: prevention behaviors, mortality and fear, symptoms, transmission and natural history, or other precautions. The characteristics of videos that were coded included number of views, length in minutes, language, presentation style, and source and date of upload. Three sources of upload comprised mutually exclusive and exhaustive categories: consumer, professional (MD or RN), and television- or internet-based news. Author CJ coded content across all videos, and a second author (CHB) coded a randomly selected subset of 10 videos to ascertain inter-rater reliability, which was assessed using Cohen kappa and found to be excellent (k=0.971).
Descriptive statistics were calculated, including frequencies and percentages and, where appropriate, means and standard deviations. Differences between content covered in videos uploaded from different sources was assessed by chi-square tests using a two-sided P value","['Corey H Basch', 'Grace C Hillyer', 'Zoe C Meleo-Erwin', 'Christie Jaime', 'Jan Mohlman', 'Charles E Basch', 'Loading Authors...', 'Corresponding Author']",

Abstract
This paper investigates the relationship between nationwide Google search queries of ""covid-19"" and ""unemployment"" using daily data from the United States. The investigation is achieved by employing a structural vector autoregression model, where nationwide queries of ""interest rate"" and ""inflation"" are also included. Historical decomposition analysis suggests that the spike in the nationwide search interest of ""unemployment"" is mostly explained by that of ""covid-19"" in mid-March 2020. One unit of a positive nationwide ""covid-19"" shock results in about 8.1 units of a significant cumulative increase in nationwide ""unemployment"" after two months, ranging between about 2.5 and about 9.3 across U.S. states when the additional state-level search query of ""unemployment"" is included, suggesting unequal ""unemployment"" effects of ""covid-19"" across states. Regarding monetary policy, one unit of a negative nationwide ""interest rate"" shock results in 0.4 units of a significant cumulative reduction in nationwide ""unemployment"" after two months, although the corresponding effects range as between 1.3 units of an increase and 0.5 units of a reduction in ""unemployment"" across U.S. states, suggesting evidence for redistributive effects of nationwide monetary policy.",['Yilmazkuday'],2020-04-14 00:00:00

Global public interest in this new issue largely reflects people‚Äôs attention to COVID-19 and their willingness to take precautionary actions. This study aimed to examine global public awareness of COVID-19 using Google Trends.
Methods: Using Google Trends, we retrieved public query data for terms of [2019-nCoV + SARS-CoV-2 + novel coronavirus + new coronavirus + COVID-19 + Corona Virus Disease 2019] between 31th Dec 2019 and 24th Feb 2020 in six major English-speaking countries, including the USA, the UK, Canada, Ireland, Australia, and New Zealand. Dynamic series analysis demonstrates the overall change trend of relative search volume (RSV) for the topic on COVID-19. The correlation between daily search volumes on the topic related to COVID-19 and the daily number of people infected with SARS-CoV-2 was analyzed.
Findings: Our studies observed the overall search trend of RSV regarding COVID-19 increased during the early period of observing time, and reached the first apex on 31th Jan 2020 in most countries. The highest increase speed of RSV occurred around 20th Jan 2020. People in the USA (3 days), the UK (10 days), Australia (10 days), and Canada (14 days) had a faster response speed toward COVID-19 than that in New Zealand (21 days) and Ireland (21 days). The duration of public attention in New Zealand (11 days) and Ireland (12 days) was shorter than that in the USA (27 days), the UK (23 days), Australia (22 days) and Canada (13 days). A slightly positive correlation between daily RSV on the topic related to COVID-19 and the daily number of people infected with SARS-CoV-2 was observed in most countries ( p <0¬∑05). People across countries presented a various interest to the RSV related to COVID-19, and public awareness of COVID-19 was also different in various sub-regions within each country.
Interpretations: Current study reminds us that governments should strengthen the publicity of COVID-19 nationally, reinforce the public's vigilance and sensitivity to COVID-19, inform public the importance of protecting themselves with enough precautionary measures, and finally control the spread of COVID-19 globally.

Social media search indexes (SMSI) for dry cough, fever, chest distress, coronavirus, and pneumonia were collected from 31 December 2019 to 9 February 2020. The new suspected cases of COVID-19 data were collected from 20 January 2020 to 9 February 2020. We used the lagged series of SMSI to predict new suspected COVID-19 case numbers during this period. To avoid overfitting, five methods, namely subset selection, forward selection, lasso regression, ridge regression, and elastic net, were used to estimate coefficients. We selected the optimal method to predict new suspected COVID-19 case numbers from 20 January 2020 to 9 February 2020. We further validated the optimal method for new confirmed cases of COVID-19 from 31 December 2019 to 17 February 2020. The new suspected COVID-19 case numbers correlated significantly with the lagged series of SMSI. SMSI could be detected 6‚Äì9 days earlier than new suspected cases of COVID-19. The optimal method was the subset selection method, which had the lowest estimation error and a moderate number of predictors. The subset selection method also significantly correlated with the new confirmed COVID-19 cases after validation. SMSI findings on lag day 10 were significantly correlated with new confirmed COVID-19 cases. SMSI could be a significant predictor of the number of COVID-19 infections. SMSI could be an effective early predictor, which would enable governments‚Äô health departments to locate potential and high-risk outbreak areas.

An understanding of the prevalence and contagiousness of the disease, and of whether the strategies used to contain it to date have been successful, is important for understanding future containment strategies.
One strategy for containment of SARS-CoV-2 is restriction of travel. After 23 January, 2020, long-range travel restrictions in China were imposed by shutting down airports. Chinazzi et al. have used a metapopulation-level disease-transmission model to predict the effects of the travel limitations on the spread of the epidemic. They have found that these measures only modestly affected the epidemic‚Äôs trajectory.
Li et al. have used analysis of reported infections within China along with mobility data to infer the epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2. Their analyses indicate that before the travel restrictions, 86% of infections were undocumented. Importantly, undocumented infections were the infection source for 79% of documented cases, thus further indicating that containment will be challenging.

The rich data from the Open COVID-19 Data Working Group include the dates when people first reported symptoms, not just a positive test date. Using these data and real-time travel data from the internet services company Baidu, Kraemer et al. found that mobility statistics offered a precise record of the spread of SARS-CoV-2 among the cities of China at the start of 2020. The frequency of introductions from Wuhan were predictive of the size of the epidemic sparked in other provinces. However, once the virus had escaped Wuhan, strict local control measures such as social isolation and hygiene, rather than long-distance travel restrictions, played the largest part in controlling SARS-CoV-2 spread.
The ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak expanded rapidly throughout China. Major behavioral, clinical, and state interventions were undertaken to mitigate the epidemic and prevent the persistence of the virus in human populations in China and worldwide. It remains unclear how these unprecedented interventions, including travel restrictions, affected COVID-19 spread in China. We used real-time mobility data from Wuhan and detailed case data including travel history to elucidate the role of case importation in transmission in cities across China and to ascertain the impact of control measures. Early on, the spatial distribution of COVID-19 cases in China was explained well by human mobility data. After the implementation of control measures, this correlation dropped and growth rates became negative in most locations, although shifts in the demographics of reported cases were still indicative of local chains of transmission outside of Wuhan. This study shows that the drastic control measures implemented in China substantially mitigated the spread of COVID-19.
The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) spread rapidly from its origin in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China (1). A range of interventions were implemented after the detection in late December 2019 of a cluster of pneumonia cases of unknown etiology and identification of the causative virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome‚Äìcoronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), in early January 2020 (2). Interventions include improved rates of diagnostic testing; clinical management; rapid isolation of suspected cases, confirmed cases, and contacts; and, most notably, restrictions on mobility (hereafter called cordon sanitaire) imposed on Wuhan city on 23 January 2020. Travel restrictions were subsequently imposed on 14 other cities across Hubei Province, and partial movement restrictions were enacted in many cities across China. Initial analysis suggests that the Wuhan cordon sanitaire resulted in an average 3-day delay of COVID-19 spread to other cities (3), but the full extent of the effect of the mobility restrictions and other types of interventions on transmission has not been examined quantitatively (4‚Äì6). Questions remain over how these interventions affected the spread of SARS-CoV-2 to locations outside of Wuhan. Here, we used real-time mobility data, crowdsourced line list data of cases with reported travel history, and timelines of reporting changes to identify early shifts in the epidemiological dynamics of the COVID-19 epidemic in China, from an epidemic driven by frequent importations to local transmission.
Human mobility predicts the spread and size of epidemics in China
As of 1 March 2020, 79,986 cases of COVID-19 were confirmed in China (Fig. 1A) (7). Reports of cases in China were mostly restricted to Hubei until 23 January 2020 (81% of all cases), after which most provinces reported rapid increases in cases (Fig. 1A). We built a line list dataset from reported cases in China with information on travel history and demographic characteristics (8). We note that the majority of early cases (before 23 January 2020; see the materials and methods) reported outside of Wuhan had known travel history to Wuhan (57%) and were distributed across China (Fig. 1B), highlighting the importance of Wuhan as a major source of early cases. However, initial testing was focused mainly on travelers from Wuhan, potentially biasing estimates of travel-related infections upward (see the materials and methods). Among cases known to have traveled from Wuhan before 23 January 2020, the time from symptom onset to confirmation was 6.5 days (SD = 4.2 days; fig. S2), providing opportunity for onward transmission at the destination. More active surveillance reduced this interval to 4.8 days (SD = 3.03 days; fig. S2) for those who traveled after 23 January 2020.

The black line represents the closure of the Wuhan seafood market on 1 January 2020. The width of each horizontal tube represents the number of reported cases in that province. (B) Map of COVID-19 confirmed cases (n = 554) that had reported travel history from Wuhan before travel restrictions were implemented on 23 January 2020. Colors of the lines indicate date of travel relative to the date of travel restrictions.
To identify accurately a time frame for evaluating early shifts in SARS-CoV-2 transmission in China, we first estimated from case data the average incubation period of COVID-19 infection [i.e., the duration between time of infection and symptom onset (9, 10)]. Because infection events are typically not observed directly, we estimated the incubation period from the span of exposure during which infection likely occurred. Using detailed information on 38 cases for whom both the dates of entry to and exit from Wuhan were known, we estimated the mean incubation period to be 5.1 days (SD = 3.0 days; fig. S1), similar to previous estimates from other data (11, 12). In subsequent analyses, we added an upper estimate of one incubation period (mean + 1 SD = 8 days) to the date of Wuhan shutdown to delineate the date before which cases recorded in other provinces might represent infections acquired in Hubei (i.e., 1 February 2020; Fig. 1A).
To understand whether the volume of travel within China could predict the epidemic outside of Wuhan, we analyzed real-time human mobility data from Baidu Inc., together with epidemiological data from each province (see the materials and methods). We investigated spatiotemporal disease spread to elucidate the relative contribution of Wuhan to transmission elsewhere and to evaluate how the cordon sanitaire may have affected it.
Among cases reported outside of Hubei province in our dataset, we observed 515 cases with known travel history to Wuhan and a symptom onset date before 31 January 2020, compared with only 39 cases after 31 January 2020, illustrating the effect of travel restrictions (Figs. 1B and 2A and fig. S3). We confirmed the expected decline of importation with real-time human mobility data from Baidu Inc. Movements of individuals out of Wuhan increased in the days before the Lunar New Year and the establishment of the cordon sanitaire, before rapidly decreasing to almost no movement (Fig. 2, A and B). The travel ban appears to have prevented travel into and out of Wuhan around the time of the Lunar New Year celebration (Fig. 2A) and likely reduced further dissemination of SARS-CoV-2 from Wuhan.

(B) Relative movements from Wuhan to other provinces in China. (C) Timeline of the correlation between daily incidence in Wuhan and incidence in all other provinces, weighted by human mobility.
To test the contribution of the epidemic in Wuhan to seeding epidemics elsewhere in China, we built a na√Øve COVID-19 ‚Äúgeneralized‚Äù linear model [GLM (13)] of daily case counts (see the materials and methods). We estimated the epidemic doubling time outside of Hubei to be 4.0 days (range across provinces, 3.6 to 5.0 days) and estimated the epidemic doubling time within Hubei to be 7.2 days, consistent with previous reports (5, 12, 14, 15). Our model predicted daily case counts across all provinces with relatively high accuracy (as measured with a pseudo-R2 from a negative binomial GLM) throughout early February 2020 and when accounting for human mobility (Fig. 2C and tables S1 and S2), consistent with an exploratory analysis (6).
We found that the magnitude of the early epidemic (total number of cases until 10 February 2020) outside of Wuhan was very well predicted by the volume of human movement out of Wuhan alone (R2 = 0.89 from a log-linear regression using cumulative cases; fig. S8). Therefore, cases exported from Wuhan before the cordon sanitaire appear to have contributed to initiating local chains of transmission, both in neighboring provinces (e.g., Henan) and in more distant provinces (e.g., Guangdong and Zhejiang) (Figs. 1A and 2B). Further, the frequency of introductions from Wuhan were also predictive of the size of the early epidemic in other provinces (controlling for population size) and thus the probability of large outbreaks (fig. S8).
After 1 February 2020 (corresponding to one mean + one SD incubation period after the cordon sanitaire and other interventions were implemented), the correlation of daily case counts and human mobility from Wuhan decreased (Fig. 2C), indicating that variability among locations in daily case counts was better explained by factors unrelated to human mobility, such as local public health response. This suggests that whereas travel restrictions may have reduced the flow of case importations from Wuhan, other local mitigation strategies aimed at halting local transmission increased in importance later.
We also estimated the growth rates of the epidemic in all other provinces (see the materials and methods). We found that all provinces outside of Hubei experienced faster growth rates between 9 January and 22 January 2020 (Fig. 3, A and B, and fig. S4b), which was the time before travel restrictions and substantial control measures were implemented (Fig. 3C and fig. S6); this was also apparent from the case counts by province (fig. S6). In the same period, variation in the growth rates is almost entirely explained by human movements from Wuhan (Fig. 3C and fig. S9), consistent with the theory of infectious disease spread in highly coupled metapopulations (16, 17). After the implementation of drastic control measures across the country, growth rates became negative (Fig. 3B), indicating that transmission was successfully mitigated. The correlation of growth rates and human mobility from Wuhan became negative; that is, provinces with larger mobility from Wuhan before the cordon sanitaire (but also larger number of cases overall) had more rapidly declining growth rates of daily case counts. This could be due partly to travel restrictions but also to the fact that control measures may have been more drastic in locations with larger outbreaks driven by local transmission (for more details, see ‚ÄúCurrent role of imported cases in Chinese provinces‚Äù section).

(C) Relationship between growth rate and human mobility at different times of the epidemic. Blue indicates before the implementation of the cordon sanitaire and green after.
The travel ban coincided with increased testing capacity across provinces in China. Therefore, an alternative hypothesis is that the observed epidemiological patterns outside of Wuhan were the result of increased testing capacity. We tested this hypothesis by including differences in testing capacity before and after the rollout of large-scale testing in China on 20 January 2020 [the date that COVID-19 became a class B notifiable disease (18, 19)] and determined the impact of this binary variable on the predictability of daily cases (see the materials and methods). We plotted the relative improvement in the prediction of our model (on the basis of normalized residual error) of (i) a model that includes daily mobility from Wuhan and (ii) a model that includes testing availability (for more details, see the materials and methods). Overall, the inclusion of mobility data from Wuhan produced an improvement in the model‚Äôs prediction [delta-Bayesian information criterion > 250 (20)] over a na√Øve model that considers only autochthonous transmission with a doubling time of 2 to 8 days (Fig. 3B). Of the 27 provinces in China reporting cases through 6 February 2020, we found that the largest improvements in prediction for 12 provinces could be achieved using mobility only (fig. S5). In 10 provinces, both testing and mobility improved the model‚Äôs prediction, and in only one province (Hunan) was testing the most important factor improving model prediction (fig. S5). We conclude that laboratory testing during the early phase of the epidemic was critical; however, mobility out of Wuhan remained the main driver of spread before the cordon sanitaire. Large-scale molecular and serological data will be important to investigate further the exact magnitude of the impact of human mobility compared with other factors.","['Moritz U. G.

To understand how travel and quarantine influence the dynamics of the spread of this novel human virus, Chinazzi et al. applied a global metapopulation disease transmission model to epidemiological data from China. They concluded that the travel quarantine introduced in Wuhan on 23 January 2020 only delayed epidemic progression by 3 to 5 days within China, but international travel restrictions did help to slow spread elsewhere in the world until mid-February. Their results suggest that early detection, hand washing, self-isolation, and household quarantine will likely be more effective than travel restrictions at mitigating this pandemic.

Abstract Motivated by the rapid spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in mainland China, we use a global metapopulation disease transmission model to project the impact of travel limitations on the national and international spread of the epidemic. The model is calibrated on the basis of internationally reported cases and shows that, at the start of the travel ban from Wuhan on 23 January 2020, most Chinese cities had already received many infected travelers. The travel quarantine of Wuhan delayed the overall epidemic progression by only 3 to 5 days in mainland China but had a more marked effect on the international scale, where case importations were reduced by nearly 80% until mid-February. Modeling results also indicate that sustained 90% travel restrictions to and from mainland China only modestly affect the epidemic trajectory unless combined with a 50% or higher reduction of transmission in the community.
Beginning in December 2019, Chinese health authorities have been closely monitoring a cluster of pneumonia cases in the city of Wuhan in Hubei province, China. The pathogen that causes the viral pneumonia in affected individuals is the newly recognized coronavirus known as severe acute respiratory syndrome‚Äìcoronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (1). As of 3 March 2020, 80,151 cases (2) have been detected and confirmed in mainland China. Internationally, more than 10,566 additional cases have been detected and confirmed in 72 countries (3). In this work, we model both the domestic and international spread of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic. We estimate the effects of the travel ban implemented in Wuhan and the international travel restrictions adopted by several countries in early February 2020.
To model the international spread of the COVID-19 outbreak, we used the global epidemic and mobility model (GLEAM), an individual-based, stochastic, and spatial epidemic model (4‚Äì7). GLEAM uses a metapopulation network approach integrated with real-world data where the world is divided into subpopulations centered around major transportation hubs (usually airports). The subpopulations are connected by the flux of individuals traveling daily among them. The model includes more than 3200 subpopulations in roughly 200 different countries and territories. The airline transportation data encompass daily origin-destination traffic flows from the Official Aviation Guide (OAG) and International Air Transport Association (IATA) databases (updated in 2019), whereas ground mobility flows are derived from the analysis and modeling of data collected from the statistics offices of 30 countries on five continents (5). Mobility variations in mainland China were derived from Baidu location-based services (LBS). Within each subpopulation, the human-to-human transmission of COVID-19 is modeled by using a compartmental representation of the disease in which individuals can occupy one of the following states: susceptible, latent, infectious, and removed. Susceptible individuals can acquire the virus through contacts with individuals in the infectious category and can subsequently become latent (i.e., infected but not yet able to transmit the infection). Latent individuals progress to the infectious stage at a rate inversely proportional to the latent period (which we assume to have the same duration as the incubation period), and infectious individuals progress to the removed stage at a rate inversely proportional to the infectious period. The sum of the mean latent and infectious periods defines the generation time. Removed individuals are those who can no longer infect others (i.e., they are isolated, hospitalized, have recovered, or have died).
The model generates an ensemble of possible epidemic scenarios described by the number of newly generated infections, time of disease arrival in each subpopulation, and number of traveling infection carriers. We assume a starting date of the epidemic that falls between 15 November 2019 and 1 December 2019, with 40 infections caused by zoonotic exposure (8‚Äì11). The transmission dynamic is calibrated by using an approximate Bayesian computation approach (12) to estimate the posterior distribution of the basic reproductive number R 0 by exploring the likelihood of importation of COVID-19 infections to international locations (13). We assume that the overall global detection of imported infections can be as low as 40% (14, 15). Data on importation of cases were obtained from available published line lists (16, 17).
We performed a sensitivity analysis by considering different combinations of average latent and infectious periods, detection rates, initial conditions, and a generation time (T g ) ranging from 6 to 11 days on the basis of plausible ranges from the SARS epidemic and recent analysis of COVID-19 data (16, 18‚Äì23). Details and sensitivity analysis on all parameters are reported in the supplementary materials (12). Here we report the results for T g = 7.5 days (20). The obtained posterior distribution provides an average R 0 = 2.57 [90% confidence interval (CI): 2.37 to 2.78] and a doubling time of T d = 4.2 days (90% CI: 3.8 to 4.7 days). The obtained values are in the same range as previous analyses based on early COVID-19 data (9, 20, 24‚Äì26). Although the calibration obtained for different generation times provides different posterior distributions for R 0 , in the early stages of the epidemic the prevalence of infections and case importations is determined by the epidemic growth rate, and the obtained results (12) are consistent with those reported here.
Wuhan travel ban On 22 January 2020, the projected median number of infections with no travel restrictions for mainland China, excluding Wuhan, was 7474 (90% CI: 3529 to 16,142). The overwhelming majority of infections were in Wuhan with a median number of 117,584 (90% CI: 62,468 to 199,581). To analyze the effect of the travel ban from Wuhan, we implemented long-range travel restrictions beginning on 23 January (airport shutdown). Furthermore, we modeled mobility limitations within mainland China by using de-identified and aggregated domestic population movement data between Chinese provinces for February 2020, as derived from Baidu LBS (12). Initially, we assumed no changes in transmissibility and disease dynamics (the status quo scenario). The model output shows no noticeable differences in the epidemic trajectory of Wuhan but a delay of ~3 days for other locations in mainland China (Fig. 1A). The overall reduction of infections in mainland China, excluding Wuhan, was close to 10% by 31 January 2020, with a relative reduction of infections across specific locations ranging from 1 to 58% (Fig. 2). With a doubling time of 4 to 5 days, this level of reduction corresponds to only a modest delay (1 to 6 days) of the epidemic trajectory in mainland China. These results are in agreement with estimates from the combination of epidemiological and human mobility data (27). The model clearly indicates that, as of 23 January 2020, the epidemic was seeded in several locations across mainland China. As an independent validation test, we assessed the cumulative number of cases in mainland China provinces through 1 February 2020 (Fig. 1B), as reported from the official World Health Organization (WHO) situation report (28), and compared these results with model projections. The model projections are highly correlated with the observed data (Pearson‚Äôs correlation coefficient = 0.74, P < 0.00001), although, as expected, we found that there are significantly fewer reported cases than projected (Fig. 1B). If we assume that the number of reported cases in the WHO situation report and in the simulation are related through a simple binomial stochastic sampling process, we find that the median ascertainment rate of detecting an infected individual in mainland China is 24.4% (interquartile range: 12.7 to 35.8%). In other words, the modeling results suggest that, in mainland China, only one in four infections is detected and confirmed. Fig. 1 Effect of the Wuhan travel ban on the COVID-19 epidemic.

Shaded areas represent 99% reference ranges. We report the observed data of international case importations with a travel history from China, classified by arrival date. We also report scenarios with relative transmissibility reduction r. Data points after 23 January 2020 were used for out-of-sample validation and were not used in the model calibration.

Circle color represents the relative reduction in the number of infections, whereas circle size corresponds to population. (B) Projected cumulative number of infections by the same date, after implementation of travel restrictions in Wuhan. A resolution of 0.25¬∞ by 0.25¬∞ geographical cells was used in the model.
Relative risk of case importation The model also allows us to estimate the number of case importations in international locations from mainland China. In Fig. 1C, we report the mean number of total international importation events in a fully status quo scenario as opposed to a travel ban. We find a 77% reduction in cases imported from mainland China to other countries as a result of the Wuhan travel ban in early February. Although the number of cases imported internationally decreases markedly at first, it picks up again in the following weeks with importation from locations in mainland China. The model indicates that, after the travel restrictions in Wuhan are implemented on 23 January, the five origin cities with the highest rates of international case importations are Shanghai, Beijing, Shenzhen, Guangzhou, and Kunming. Similarly, the model can rank countries across the world according to the relative risk of importing cases from mainland China. More precisely, the relative risk is defined for each country Y as the relative probability P(Y) that a single infected individual travels from an area affected by the epidemic to that specific destination Y. In other words, given the occurrence of one exported case, P(Y) is the relative probability that the disease carrier will appear in location Y, with respect to any other possible location. This risk depends on the travel flow from cities in mainland China to other countries and the disease prevalence in those cities. Notably, the traffic flows used in the model are origin-destination data that do not depend on traveling routes (i.e., a proxy for the actual mobility demand across cities). Figure 3 illustrates how the cities with the most COVID-19 cases in mainland China contribute to the relative risk of the 20 countries that are most susceptible to case importation, both before and after implementation of the Wuhan travel ban . In particular, before the travel ban, ‚âà86% of the internationally imported cases originated from Wuhan. After the travel ban, the top 10 contributors to the relative risk‚Äîof which the top three are Shanghai (28.1%), Beijing (14%), and Shenzhen (12.8%)‚Äîaccounted for at least ‚âà80% of the internationally imported cases. The countries most at risk of importation after the implementation of the Wuhan travel ban are Japan (11% pre-ban, 13.9% post-ban), Thailand (22.8% pre-ban, 13% post-ban), the Republic of Korea (7.4% pre-ban, 11.3% post-ban), Taiwan (9.5% pre-ban, 10% post-ban), and the United States (4.7% pre-ban, 5.7% post-ban). Fig. 3 Relative risk of case importation. Contribution to the relative risk of importation from the 10 Chinese cities with the highest rates of disease (plus the rest of mainland China) until 22 January 2020 (left) and after the Wuhan travel ban from 23 January to 1 March 2020 (right). The listed countries are the 20 countries at greatest risk of case importation. Flows are proportional to the relative probability that a single imported case will travel from a given origin to a specific destination.
International travel restrictions and transmissibility reduction Starting in early February 2020, 59 airline companies suspended or limited flights to mainland China, and several countries‚Äîincluding the United States, Russia, Australia, and Italy‚Äîhave imposed government-issued travel restrictions (29‚Äì34). It is difficult to calculate exactly the level of traffic reduction imposed by these measures. For this reason, we analyzed two major scenarios in which international travel restrictions produce a 40 and 90% overall traffic reduction to and from mainland China. A relative reduction of transmissibility could be achieved through early detection and isolation of cases, as well as behavioral changes and awareness of the disease in the population. Along with travel reductions, we considered three scenarios pertaining to disease transmissibility: (i) a status quo situation with the same transmissibility as that from the model calibration through 23 January 2020; (ii) a moderate relative reduction of the original transmissibility (25%), corresponding to a transmissibility dampening factor of r = 0.75; and (iii) a strong reduction (50%) of the original transmissibility (r = 0.50). In Fig. 4, we show the combined effects of the travel and transmissibility reductions on the epidemic incidence in mainland China and the number of exported cases to other countries. Fig. 4 Combined effects of travel and transmissibility reductions on the epidemic. (A) Median total number of imported infections from mainland China with no transmissibility reduction and travel reductions of 40 and 90%. (B) Same as (A) for the moderate transmissibility reduction scenario (r = 0.75). (C) Same as (A) for the strong transmissibility reduction scenario (r = 0.5). Shaded areas represent 90% CIs. (D) Disease incidence in mainland China, excluding Wuhan, for the scenarios plotted in (A) to (C). The simulated scenarios reveal that even in the case of 90% travel reductions (Fig. 4D), if transmissibility is not reduced (r = 1), the epidemic in mainland China would be delayed for no more than 2 weeks. The model projects that, in the status quo scenario, the peak of the epidemic in mainland China will be reached in late April to early May 2020. Notably, in the absence of transmissibility reductions, the epidemic would peak in Wuhan during the first week of March. The number of infections imported in other countries (Fig. 4, A to C) was initially affected by a 10-fold reduction, but by 1 March, when there is no transmissibility reduction (r = 1), we would again see 170 and 35 detected cases per day for the 40 and 90% travel restrictions scenarios, respectively. However, the concurrent presence of both travel and transmissibility reductions produces a much larger synergistic effect that becomes visible by delaying both the epidemic activity in mainland China and the number of internationally imported infections. In the moderate transmissibility reduction scenarios (r = 0.75), the epidemic peak is delayed to late June 2020, and the total number of international infection importations by 1 March is 26 cases per day for the 40% scenario and 5 per day for the 90% scenario. Even more restrictive travel limitations (>90%) would extend the period during which the importation of infections is greatly reduced. Strong transmissibility reduction (r = 0.5) along with travel restrictions would delay the epidemic growth in mainland China such that the daily incidence rate would never surpass 1 infection per 1000 people and the number of imported infections at international destinations would always be in the single-digit range. The effect of transmissibility reduction on the short-term epidemic curve in mainland China is also visible (Fig. 1A): There is a pronounced reduction in the number of infections by 22 February 2020, with respect to the status quo epidemic curve. We also report the estimated number of detected international importations, as determined by the model in the strong transmissibility reduction scenario (Fig. 1C). The results are consistent with the data collected from the travel history of international imported cases after 23 January 2020 (16, 17). Similar results are obtained by assuming that the transmissibility reduction interventions successfully reduce the reproductive number below the epidemic threshold in the second half of February, as data from mainland China seem to suggest (28). Notably, many infected individuals from mainland China have not been detected and have potentially dispersed to international locations. By 1 February 2020, in the strong transmissibility reduction scenario, the model estimates 101 (90% CI: 50 to 173) importation events, with one or more potential infections that could seed multiple epidemic outbreaks across the world, potentially leading to the international expansion of the COVID-19 epidemic. This finding is consistent with the emergence of COVID-19 outbreaks in countries such as Italy, the Republic of Korea, and Iran in the second half of February 2020. Our analysis, as with all modeling exercises, has several limitations and requires certain assumptions. The model parameters, such as generation time and incubation period, are chosen on the basis of early data associated with the COVID-19 outbreak and prior knowledge of SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus epidemiology. Although the model is stable to variations in these parameters, more information on the key characteristic of the disease would considerably reduce uncertainties. At this stage, the transmission and mobility model does not account for heterogeneities due to age differences in susceptibility and contact patterns. The model calibration does not consider correlations among importations (family travel) and assumes that travel probabilities are homogeneous across all individuals in the catchment area of each transportation hub. We were not able to find reliable data on the effectiveness of containment measures (e.g., body temperature screening for passengers on flights departing from Wuhan International Airport) in mainland China before 23 January, so this information is not included in the model. In the travel restriction scenario, we assume long-term enforcement of individual mobility restrictions (travel was restricted until the end of June 2020), but this policy may not be feasible or sustainable for such a long period.
Discussion The analysis of the COVID-19 outbreak and the modeling assessment of the effects of travel limitations could be beneficial to national and international agencies for public health response planning. We show that, by 23 January 2020, the epidemic had already spread to other cities within mainland China. The travel quarantine around Wuhan has only modestly delayed the spread of disease to other areas of mainland China. This finding is consistent with the results of separate studies on the diffusion of SARS-CoV-2 in mainland China (27, 35, 36). The model indicates that although the Wuhan travel ban was initially effective at reducing international case importations, the number of imported cases outside mainland China will continue to grow after 2 to 3 weeks. Furthermore, the modeling study shows that additional travel limitations (up to 90% of traffic) have only a modest effect unless paired with public health interventions and behavioral changes that can facilitate a considerable reduction in disease transmissibility (37). The model also indicates that, despite the strong restrictions on travel to and from mainland China since 23 January 2020, many individuals exposed to SARS-CoV-2 have been traveling internationally without being detected. Moving forward, we expect that travel restrictions to COVID-19‚Äìaffected areas will have modest effects and that transmission reduction interventions will provide the greatest benefit for mitigating the epidemic. Our results provide data with potential uses for the definition of optimized containment schemes and mitigation policies, including the local and international dimensions of the COVID-19 epidemic.

Our results show that these measures likely slowed the rate of exportation from mainland China to other countries, but are insufficient to contain the global spread of COVID-19. With most cases arriving during the asymptomatic incubation period, our results suggest that rapid contact tracing is essential both within the epicenter and at importation sites to limit human-to-human transmission outside of mainland China.
Abstract The novel coronavirus outbreak (COVID-19) in mainland China has rapidly spread across the globe. Within 2 mo since the outbreak was first reported on December 31, 2019, a total of 566 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS CoV-2) cases have been confirmed in 26 other countries. Travel restrictions and border control measures have been enforced in China and other countries to limit the spread of the outbreak. We estimate the impact of these control measures and investigate the role of the airport travel network on the global spread of the COVID-19 outbreak. Our results show that the daily risk of exporting at least a single SARS CoV-2 case from mainland China via international travel exceeded 95% on January 13, 2020. We found that 779 cases (95% CI: 632 to 967) would have been exported by February 15, 2020 without any border or travel restrictions and that the travel lockdowns enforced by the Chinese government averted 70.5% (95% CI: 68.8 to 72.0%) of these cases. In addition, during the first three and a half weeks of implementation, the travel restrictions decreased the daily rate of exportation by 81.3% (95% CI: 80.5 to 82.1%), on average. At this early stage of the epidemic, reduction in the rate of exportation could delay the importation of cases into cities unaffected by the COVID-19 outbreak, buying time to coordinate an appropriate public health response.
In December 2019, a novel coronavirus outbreak, COVID-19, caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), emerged in Wuhan, China, as a cluster of cases exhibiting pneumonia-like symptoms (1). Within a few weeks, the outbreak spread to 24 other countries around the world, including the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, France, Australia, and Japan (2). As of February 21, 2020, more than 76,000 cases have been confirmed globally, of which 1.8% have been reported outside mainland China (2, 3).
The current COVID-19 outbreak marks the third novel coronavirus emergence in the 21st century, after the 2003 SARS and the 2013 Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). The 2003 SARS epidemic originated in China‚Äôs Guangdong province, resulting in 5,327 cases within the country and 8,096 infections globally (4). In response to its global spread, many countries implemented airport screening, which was later found to be ineffective in slowing the spread of disease (5‚áì‚Äì7). As of February 21, the World Health Organization has reported 566 confirmed cases in 26 other countries, 14 of which have reported human-to-human transmission (8), with an additional 634 cases being confirmed on a cruise ship (8).
On January 23, 2020, China enacted a lockdown in Wuhan City to limit the spread of COVID-19 outbreak, which was expanded to 15 other cities in Hubei province on January 24 (9‚áì‚áì‚áì‚áì‚áì‚Äì15). With the global dissemination of SARS-CoV-2 cases out of China, several countries have instituted border measures, including symptom screening and restricting travel to and from China (16‚áì‚áì‚Äì19). Some countries are encouraging passengers from China to self-identify possible exposure via health questionnaires. Despite these interventions, the global case count continues to rise. Currently, there is limited understanding about how international flight connections and border measures are impacting the global dissemination of the COVID-19 outbreak.
We used daily COVID-19 incidence data and global airport network connectivity from mainland China to estimate country-level exportation risks of the outbreak. As expected, we found a significant correlation between the timing of global exportation events and airline connectivity with mainland China. We next evaluated the effectiveness of border measures, including travel lockdown, contact tracing at the epicenter, and airport screening in containing the spread of disease. In our analysis, we accounted for early epidemiological estimates of COVID-19 outbreak from the literature, suggesting that the average incubation period of the disease is 5.2 d but can extend to more than 12 d for some individuals (10, 20). Using Monte Carlo simulations, we estimated that about 64% of exported cases were in the presymptomatic incubation period upon arrival, indicating airport screening is unlikely to prevent disease importation on its own. We further found that the Wuhan and subsequent Hubei travel lockdowns reduced the rate of disease exportation by 81% and averted 71% cases by February 15, 2020, compared to no border restriction. Border control measures are thus unlikely to contain the outbreak, but could likely delay further importation of SARS CoV-2 cases at the early stage of the epidemic.
Results Exportation Risk and Impact of Border Control Measures. By January 13, 2020 (95% CI: January 11‚àí14), the daily risk of exporting at least a single infected case from mainland China via international travel exceeded 95% (Fig. 1A). We estimated that the first case was exported from mainland China on December 26, 2019 (95% CI: December 24‚àí28), with a SD of 7.2 d. We found that December 31, 2019 (95% CI: December 31, 2019 to January 2, 2020) had the greatest likelihood for the first exportation event out of China (Fig. 1C), corresponding to 23 d (95% CI: 21 to 23) before the initiation of the travel lockdown in Wuhan. These estimates are relatively comparable to the arrival of infected individuals in Australia and Japan on January 6, 2020 (Table 1 and SI Appendix, Table S5). Fig. 1. Exportation risk of SARS-CoV-2 cases from mainland China. (A) Daily risk, (B) cumulative risk of exportation of at least one case, and (C) risk of the initial exportation event from mainland China between December 6, 2019 and February 15, 2020. (D and E) Expected number of exported cases from mainland China traveling during the incubation period (blue) or symptomatic phase of the infection (yellow) (D) in the absence of travel lockdowns and (E) with travel lockdowns enforced. (F) Cases averted by the travel lockdowns. The colored band in A‚àíC denotes the 95% credible interval. The vertical dashed lines indicate the start of two travel lockdowns in China: January 23, 2020 in Wuhan and January 25, 2020 for other cities in the Hubei province. Table 1. The estimate of the date of an infected case being exported to a given country in comparison to the first arrival of a reported infected case The two travel lockdowns have reduced the exportation rate from mainland China, but are insufficient to contain geographic spread (Fig. 1). Since the time of the initial lockdown on January 23, we estimate that the number of exported cases would have exceeded 50 by January 25, 2020 (95% CI: January 24‚àí26) without border restrictions, compared to January 28, 2020 (95% CI: January 27‚àí30) under the enforcement of the travel lockdowns. Over the course of the 24 d of the travel lockdowns, we found that an average of five cases (95% CI: 4 to 6) were exported per day, an 81.3% (95% CI: 80.5 to 82.1%) average reduction in the exportation rate predicted in the absence of any border measures. We estimate that the travel lockdowns reduced the number of COVID-19 importations by February 15, 2020, from 779 (95% CI: 632 to 967) to 230 (95% CI: 178 to 298). This is consistent with the 175 confirmed international SARS-CoV-2 infections by February 21, 2020, with travel history to China (8), taking reporting delays and an asymptomatic incubation period into account. We estimated that 64.3% (95% CI: 55.4 to 71.3%) of exported cases were presymptomatic upon arrival at their destination airport. Assuming that only symptomatic cases were detected by airport screening upon arrival, we estimate that screening contained 82 (95% CI: 72 to 95) cases imported from mainland China, while the two travel lockdowns averted 549 (95% CI: 451 to 670) cases being exported up to February 15, 2020. Country-Level Importation Risk. We used the global airport network to estimate the daily probability of an initial importation event for 63 countries/regions that have direct flight connectivity to mainland China (Fig. 2). We assume the importation risk is proportional to the number of airports in the country with direct flights to and from mainland China. As expected, we found that the reported arrival of the first importations for these countries was negatively correlated with the number of airports that had direct flights to and from mainland China for 21 countries/regions as of January 30, 2020 (r = ‚àí0.43, P value = 0.05; Table 1 and Fig. 2B). For example, Japan, with 60 such airports, and Sri Lanka, with one such airport, reported their first COVID-19 importations on January 6 and January 19, respectively (Fig. 2B). As validation, our predicted first arrival times are generally consistent with reported international importation arrival dates (Table 1 and SI Appendix, Table S5). Fig. 2. Country-level importation of SARS-CoV-2 cases. (A) International flight connections from mainland China. Color of the curves indicates the number of airports with flights to/from mainland China‚Äîlighter color are the routes to countries with the most airport connections. The blue circles indicate the number of international confirmed cases. Size of circles is proportional to the number of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases with travel history to China as of February, 15, 2020. (B) The risk of initial importation (yellow gradient) based on probability of an individual in mainland China to travel by flight (y axis), estimated each day between January 4, 2020 and January 31, 2020 (x axis). We found a statistically significant correlation (r = ‚àí0.43, P value = 0.05) between the reported arrival date of the initial case in 21 countries/regions and the airline weights proportional to the number of airports in the country with direct flights to and from mainland China. Vertical dashed lines indicate the travel bans that were enforced on January 23 in Wuhan and on January 25 for other cities in Hubei province. Limiting Importation through Self-Identification upon Arrival. Several countries have asked travelers that have visited areas affected by the COVID-19 outbreak to self-monitor for symptoms for 28 d after arrival (Fig. 3A). We estimated that health questionnaires for self-identification at airports inquiring about any exposure at least a week (6.3 d [95% CI: 4.9 to 7.7]) prior to arrival would catch 95% of cases traveling during the incubation period (Fig. 3B).

Time of symptom onset data for 30 imported cases worldwide is shown as dots‚Äîblue dots are the cases that displayed no symptoms upon arrival, and yellow dots are cases that were symptomatic upon arrival. Quarantine at the Epicenter to Curb Exportation. We assessed the impact of quarantine (i.e., isolation of an infected individual following exposure to infection) following contact tracing in the epicenter on preventing the international travel of cases during the incubation period. The expected benefits of contact tracing depend on the rapidity with which exposed cases are identified. For example, the likelihood of an infected case traveling during the incubation period would be reduced by 24.7% (95% CI: 20.1 to 31.8%) if the case is identified via contact tracing within 5 d after exposure. By contrast, quarantining a case 10 d after exposure would only reduce the probability of travel by 5.3% (95% CI: 4.7 to 6.7%) (Fig. 3C). Local Transmission following Case Importation. The arrival times and symptom onset of 30 reported cases outside of mainland China indicate that ‚àº67% of cases arrived during their incubation period (Fig. 3D and SI Appendix, Table S5). For such cases, we estimated the average duration between arrival and symptom onset is 3 d (95% CI: 2.3 to 3.9) (Fig. 3D). Our estimate is consistent with data from 20 importation cases around the world, indicating 3.5 d (¬±2.2 SD) between arrival and symptom onset (Fig. 3D, blue dots). Assuming the serial interval to be distributed with an average of 7.5 d and SD of 3.4 d (10), we estimated that the first transmission event occurs, on average, 4 d (95% CI: 3.2 to 4.8) after symptom onset (Fig. 3D). Thus, we expect the first local transmission event to typically occur within 7 d (95% CI: 6.0 to 8.2) after the arrival of an infected case in the incubation period. Estimation of Case Underreporting. We estimated the probability of travel per day for any individual from mainland China to be 0.0068 (95% CI: 0.0059 to 0.0079), which was reported to be 0.005 (21). Our higher estimate compared with that previously reported underscores the likelihood of case underreporting in China, as has been widely speculated. Specifically, the relative difference in these probabilities suggests an underreporting rate of 26.5% (95% CI: 15.3 to 36.7%) from December 8, 2019 to February 15, 2020. Even under a more conservative assumption that infected people travel up to the point of hospitalization, our estimates indicate 16.7% (95% CI: 3.8 to 28.6%) underreporting.
Discussion Less than 2 mo after the first international reports of COVID-19 in mainland China, international flights have brought COVID-19 cases to 26 countries. As of February 21, 2020, these countries have collectively reported 556 confirmed cases (8). An additional 634 cases have been confirmed outside of mainland China on a cruise ship (8). To limit the global spread of COVID-19, symptom screening of incoming passengers has been implemented at airports in several countries. However, with early estimates suggesting a presymptomatic incubation period lasting up to 2 wk (or more), a large proportion of infected travelers may not be detected during screening. In the calibration of our model, we considered two scenarios, for the possibility of a symptomatic individual to travel until 1) first medical visit, and 2) hospitalization (SI Appendix, Table S3). We found that the effectiveness of screening depends on this assumption, with longer symptomatic travel periods corresponding to a higher proportion of cases detected by February 15, 2020. If cases travel up to their first clinical visit [between 4.6 d and 5.8 d after symptom onset (10)], then we estimated that 64.3% (95% CI: 55.4 to 71.3%) of international COVID-19 case importations out of China were still presymptomatic (incubating) while traveling; if cases travel up to the point of hospitalization [between 9.1 d and 12.5 d after symptom onset (10)], this proportion reduces to 49.5% (95% CI: 40.4 to 57.4%), which is comparable to a previously published estimate of 46% (22). Additional information on both the incubation period and travel behavior of symptomatic individuals is required to provide more-accurate estimates of effectiveness of airport screening. On January 23, a lockdown was enforced in the city of Wuhan, followed by 15 more cities in Hubei province on January 24 (9‚áì‚áì‚áì‚Äì13). We estimated that 779 (95% CI: 632 to 967) COVID-19 cases would have been exported by February 15, 2020 if these border restrictions had not been enacted. Therefore, our results indicate that the travel lockdowns enforced by the Chinese Government averted 71% of these cases. A previous analysis evaluated city-level risk of importation events between January and March (23) but did not consider importation timing. Our analysis, which utilizes incidence data in mainland China, suggests that the first exportation event was likely to have occurred almost 3 wk before the travel ban. Our prediction of exportation timings is consistent with the timing and locations of the first 21 COVID-19 cases reported outside of China. Our results demonstrate that travel restrictions cannot be expected to fully arrest the global expansion of COVID-19, but may decrease the rate of case exportations if enacted during the early stages of the epidemic (5‚áì‚Äì7). For example, our results indicate that the travel lockdowns in Hubei decreased the rate of exportation during the early stages of the outbreak by 81%. At this early stage of the COVID-19 epidemic, this decrease in exportation rate from mainland China could delay the onset of outbreaks in cities yet to be affected. This obstruction of importation events will be critical to preparing an effective public health response for when a local COVID-19 outbreak arises. In addition to border control measures, contact tracing is being conducted in China to identify individuals potentially exposed to SARS-CoV-2 (24‚áì‚Äì26). Our results suggest that the benefits of contact tracing depend on its rapidity. These findings highlight the importance of improving contact tracing within the epicenter in alleviating the risk of importation, as the efficacy of contact tracing in unaffected countries will largely depend on their preparedness, vigilance, and available resources. We find that airport screening has only a moderate benefit during the early stages of the epidemic, as about 64% of infected individuals travel during the incubation period and exhibit symptoms an average of 3 d after arrival. Our estimate of duration between arrival and symptom onset is consistent with data of 20 imported cases reported to have arrived during the incubation period. Due to the logistical difficulty of identifying COVID-19 cases during the incubation period, some countries are requesting individuals to self-report any exposure to the virus, self-monitor for symptoms, and voluntarily quarantine if symptoms arise (17). Prior surveys of pandemic influenza suggest that the proportion of people self-isolating can range from 70 to 95% if those people are diagnosed with the disease (27, 28). The risk with this approach, however, is the uncertainty about people‚Äôs willingness to self-quarantine prior to symptom onset. To curtail local outbreaks, it is important to identify imported cases in the incubation period before onward transmission occurs. We predicted that public health officials would have to identify and quarantine these imported cases within a week of arrival to limit the risk of transmission, with earlier detection of cases being more efficient. Early detection of cases could be critical, given recent studies estimating a shorter serial interval than previously reported, assuming transmission occurs during the asymptomatic period of infection (10, 29). As of February 21, there are at least 14 countries that have reported human-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2 (8). The US Center for Disease Control reported a case of human-to-human transmission on January 30, 2020, after the index patient was diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection on January 21 (25). Our estimate of arrival time to the first transmission event corroborates with this report. With the entire city of Wuhan under quarantine, stranded international travelers are being evacuated by their countries and quarantined for 2 wk, due to the rapidly growing epidemic (30‚áì‚Äì32). To curb the burden of the COVID-19 outbreak, efforts have mounted to rapidly develop an efficacious vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 (1, 33). Our study highlights the importance of complementary containment measures, such as contact tracing and voluntary quarantine, in limiting the global spread of the pandemic. With the availability of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, the risk of additional importation can be mitigated by focusing initial distribution of these vaccines in the regions where the imported cases have been identified and, secondarily, in regions that are highly connected to the affected areas.
Methods We used daily incidence data of COVID-19 outbreak within mainland China from December 8, 2019 to February 15, 2020, as well as airline network data, to predict the number of exported cases with and without measures of travel restriction and screening. Using a maximum likelihood approach, we calibrated the daily probability that an infected person would travel out of mainland China by fitting our predictions of exported cases to reported international incidence for cases that had a travel history to China (10, 34‚áì‚áì‚áì‚áì‚Äì39) (SI Appendix, Fig. S1). We assumed that infected individuals can travel over the entire course of their incubation or symptomatic period. The distribution of the incubation period was informed by clinical estimates that suggest an average duration of 5.2 d (SI Appendix, Table S1). The longest time window over which a symptomatic case could travel was informed by an empirical distribution of the duration between symptom onset and first medical visit (SI Appendix, Table S1). Using empirical distributions of these two durations, we evaluated the risk of an infected case being exported from the epicenter. To estimate the country-specific risk of importation of an individual infected with SARS-CoV-2, the probability of travel for an infected person was informed by country-specific weights that we calculated from flight data. These weights were proportional to the number of airports within the country that have direct flights to/from mainland China (40). We validated our country-specific estimates of importation risk using data from 21 countries reporting the arrival date of the first imported case (Table 1 and SI Appendix, Table S5). For cases imported during the incubation period, we calculated likelihood distributions of the time between arrival and symptom onset using the distribution of the incubation period and probability of traveling over that period. We validated these estimates using publicly available reports (SI Appendix, Table S5). We then estimated the time to the first transmission event using the empirical estimates of serial internal distribution (time from symptom onset in the index patient to time of symptom onset in the secondary case) and distribution of incubation period (SI Appendix, Table S1). We also evaluated the impact of other nonpharmaceutical interventions, including the effectiveness both of providing health questionnaires at the airport for self-identification of possible exposure in the last 14 d and of quarantining potentially exposed cases after contact tracing in mainland China. We calculated the impact of contact tracing in mainland China on the probability that an infected case in their incubation period would travel, based on the time interval from infection to quarantine.

We conducted a systematic review of the published literature and preprints on the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak following predefined eligibility criteria. Of 317 research articles generated from our initial search on PubMed and preprint archives on 21 February 2020, 41 met our inclusion criteria and were included in the review. Current evidence suggests that it takes about 3-7 days for the epidemic to double in size. Of 21 estimates for the basic reproduction number ranging from 1.9 to 6.5, 13 were between 2.0 and 3.0. The incubation period was estimated to be 4-6 days, whereas the serial interval was estimated to be 4-8 days. Though the true case fatality risk is yet unknown, current model-based estimates ranged from 0.3% to 1.4% for outside China. There is an urgent need for rigorous research focusing on the mitigation efforts to minimize the impact on society.

Data on confirmed cases diagnosed outside China were analyzed using statistical models to estimate the impact of travel reduction on three epidemiological outcome measures: (i) the number of exported cases, (ii) the probability of a major epidemic, and (iii) the time delay to a major epidemic. From 28 January to 7 February 2020, we estimated that 226 exported cases (95% confidence interval: 86,449) were prevented, corresponding to a 70.4% reduction in incidence compared to the counterfactual scenario. The reduced probability of a major epidemic ranged from 7% to 20% in Japan, which resulted in a median time delay to a major epidemic of two days. Depending on the scenario, the estimated delay may be less than one day. As the delay is small, the decision to control travel volume through restrictions on freedom of movement should be balanced between the resulting estimated epidemiological impact and predicted economic fallout.

President Donald Trump announced on Tuesday night in a national TV broadcast that the US would be closed to all flights from Europe‚Äîexcluding the UK‚Äîfor 30 days from midnight on Friday 13 March in an attempt to stop the spread of covid-19 to the country.
Trump blamed Europe for increasing US infections, as he referred to covid-19 as a horrible disease. Reading from a teleprompter, he said that while previous measures, such as travel restrictions from China, the announcement of a public health emergency, and warnings, had led to a dramatic decrease in US infections, the problem lay with Europe.
He said the US would continue to monitor the situation with China. Previously he had restricted flights from China to the US.
Trump also said that Congress had appropriated $8.3bn (¬£6.5bn; ‚Ç¨7.4bn) to help fight the pandemic, testing was becoming more available, and the risk of infection was low for healthy Americans, but was higher for the elderly. He said nursing homes should suspend visits.
The president advised people to follow guidelines for washing their hands, cleaning surfaces, covering their mouth and nose if sneezing or coughing, and staying home if they felt ill. He promised emergency assistance for workers who might lose pay if they took sick days.
Trump assured viewers that the US economy was strong. This was not a financial crisis, he said, but a temporary moment. He promised financial support to small and medium sized businesses through the Small Business Administration.
He said he would provide immediate tax relief by deferring income tax payments, ordinarily expected by 15 April, thus contributing $200bn to the US economy.
He ended his talk by saying Americans were in this together, they would unify, and would, as always, rise to the challenge.
Commenting on Trump‚Äôs ban, Paul Hunter, professor in medicine at University of East Anglia, said, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs uncertain what the US intends to achieve with the travel ban to the Schengen area of Europe. Many of us have been pointing out since the covid-19 epidemic began that travel bans have a poor record of preventing the spread of epidemic diseases. At best, travel bans only delay the spread of an epidemic by a short while. A paper published in Science showed that the travel ban in China only delayed the spread internally by 3 to 5 days.1 It also showed that international travel bans are only modestly effective at controlling international spread.
‚ÄúIntroducing an international travel ban at a time when the US is now one of the countries with the most rapidly accelerating internal transmission rates will do little if anything to reduce the burden of infection within the US.‚Äù

The world is in the grip of the COVID-19 pandemic. Public health measures that can reduce the risk of infection and death in addition to quarantines are desperately needed. This article reviews the roles of vitamin D in reducing the risk of respiratory tract infections, knowledge about the epidemiology of influenza and COVID-19, and how vitamin D supplementation might be a useful measure to reduce risk. Through several mechanisms, vitamin D can reduce risk of infections. Those mechanisms include inducing cathelicidins and defensins that can lower viral replication rates and reducing concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines that produce the inflammation that injures the lining of the lungs, leading to pneumonia, as well as increasing concentrations of anti-inflammatory cytokines. Several observational studies and clinical trials reported that vitamin D supplementation reduced the risk of influenza, whereas others did not. Evidence supporting the role of vitamin D in reducing risk of COVID-19 includes that the outbreak occurred in winter, a time when 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) concentrations are lowest; that the number of cases in the Southern Hemisphere near the end of summer are low; that vitamin D deficiency has been found to contribute to acute respiratory distress syndrome; and that case-fatality rates increase with age and with chronic disease comorbidity, both of which are associated with lower 25(OH)D concentration. To reduce the risk of infection, it is recommended that people at risk of influenza and/or COVID-19 consider taking 10,000 IU/d of vitamin Dfor a few weeks to rapidly raise 25(OH)D concentrations, followed by 5000 IU/d. The goal should be to raise 25(OH)D concentrations above 40‚Äì60 ng/mL (100‚Äì150 nmol/L). For treatment of people who become infected with COVID-19, higher vitamin Ddoses might be useful. Randomized controlled trials and large population studies should be conducted to evaluate these recommendations.

Synairgen plc (LSE: SNG), the respiratory drug discovery and development company, today announces that it has received expedited approvals from the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) and Health Research Authority (HRA) to conduct a trial of SNG001 (inhaled formulation of interferon-beta-1a) in COVID-19 patients to potentially assist with the global outbreak of the virus.
COVID-19
COVID-19, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, is a global threat and there is an urgent need to assess new treatments to prevent and effectively treat the severe lower respiratory tract illness that can occur with this disease. Older people and those with co-morbidities such as heart and lung complications or diabetes are at greatest risk of developing severe or fatal disease.
Interferon beta (IFN-beta) potential applicability to COVID-19
Interferon beta is a naturally occurring protein, which orchestrates the body's antiviral responses. There is evidence that deficiency in IFN-beta production by the lung could explain the enhanced susceptibility of these at-risk patient groups to developing severe lower respiratory tract (lung) disease during respiratory viral infections. Furthermore, viruses, including coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV, have evolved mechanisms which suppress endogenous IFN-beta production, thereby helping the virus evade the innate immune system. The addition of exogenous IFN-beta before or during viral infection of lung cells either prevents or greatly diminishes cell damage and viral replication, respectively. Synairgen's SNG001 is a formulation of IFN-beta-1a for direct delivery to the lungs via nebulisation. It is pH neutral, and is free of mannitol, arginine and human serum albumin, making it suitable for inhaled delivery direct to the site of action.
SNG001 could prove to have an important role to play in outbreaks such as the current COVID-19 epidemic, particularly in respect of the population at highest risk of being severely affected by this and similar viruses.
SNG001 was identified in the WHO's Landscape analysis of therapeutics as at 17 February 2020 as the only Phase 2/Phase 3/Observational therapy delivered by the inhaled route ( https://www.who.int/blueprint/priority-diseases/key-action/Table_of_therapeutics_Appendix_17022020.pdf?ua=1 ).
Two Phase II clinical trials in asthma showed that inhaled SNG001 treatment activated antiviral pathways in the lung along with improving lung function in patients with a respiratory viral infection. We have also shown that treatment with inhaled SNG001 reduced lung viral load and lung pathology in an in vivo swine flu driven model of viral pneumonia. At the time of the MERS-CoV outbreak in 2013, Synairgen collaborated with the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in the US to show that SNG001 could protect against MERS-CoV infection of lung cells in vitro.
COVID-19 Clinical Trial
Synairgen's Phase II trial in COVID-19 patients (SG016) will be a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Initially, the pilot phase of the study will involve 100 COVID-19 patients, will take place across a number of NHS trusts and has been adopted by the NIHR Respiratory Translational Research Collaboration which is comprised of leading centres in respiratory medicine in the UK whose internationally recognised experts are working together to accelerate development and discovery for COVID-19. A successful outcome from the pilot phase will inform onwards progression of SNG001 in COVID-19 patients. The trial is expected to commence imminently.
Synairgen's other current activities with COVID-19
Since the outbreak of COVID-19, Synairgen has been approached by, and is in discussion with, a number of other medical, scientific, and Governmental bodies (both in the UK, US and internationally) seeking to investigate novel therapeutics in this area.
Update on SNG001 Phase II trial in COPD
Synairgen is now close to completing a Phase II study in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients with confirmed respiratory viral infections and pre-existing significant impairment of lung function. With 109 out of a target 120 participants already dosed, this trial has been paused to minimise the chance of vulnerable patients being exposed to further infection risk and to minimise distraction for respiratory staff in the UK hospitals and GP sites conducting the trial, who will be at the forefront in dealing with patients suffering from COVID-19. We are currently exploring ways to adapt the trial to enable patients in the pre-treatment pool to be dosed if they become infected with SARS-CoV-2.
Early data from this double-blind, placebo-controlled trial have demonstrated that the antiviral responses in the lung (assessed using sputum biomarkers) are similar to those observed in the asthma trial, where we saw clinical benefit in lung function.
Richard Marsden, CEO of Synairgen, commented: ""We have worked intensively with the relevant authorities and collaborators to enable SNG001 to be assessed in COVID-19 patients. SNG001 has been well tolerated in clinical trials in over 200 respiratory patients to date and has accelerated lung function recovery in two Phase II asthma trials in patients with a cold or flu infection. A successful outcome from this trial in COVID-19 patients would be a major breakthrough in the fight against this coronavirus pandemic.""
Professor Tom Wilkinson, Professor of Respiratory Medicine at the University of Southampton and Trial Chief Investigator, commented: ""We are facing an unprecedented health challenge with COVID-19 which desperately requires the rapid development of new therapeutic strategies. There are a limited number of candidate new treatments available and so it is vital we can rapidly generate high quality evidence on the role of these in COVID-19 patients. The UK research delivery and regulatory teams have worked incredibly effectively to enable this world leading trial to achieve approvals so rapidly which has enabled our motivated and highly expert team of researchers to get this vital study running straight away.""
Professor Stephen Holgate, Medical Research Council (MRC) Professor of Immunopharmacology, commented: ""The reduced innate immune response that exists in the lung of those at most risk of serious COVID-19 disease such as older people and those with pre-existing lung disease makes such patients ideal candidates to receive inhaled SNG001 to replace their interferon deficiency. This is especially so because SARS-CoV-2, along with MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, is equipped to evade this first line of viral defence. In the absence of a suitable vaccine, increasing the host's own immunity to enhance protection and virus elimination would seem a logical therapeutic approach.""

The inspiration for this thread is Eliezer's post below.
I'd like this thread to be a source of claims and ideas that are self-contained and well-explained. This is not a thread to drop one-liners that assume I've been following your particular news feed or know what's happening in your country or that I've read a bunch of studies on (say) viral load. There's a place for such high-context discussion, and it is not this thread.
Please include in your answers either a claim or an open question, along with an explanation or an explicit model under which it makes sense. I will be moving answers to the comments if they don't meet my subjective quality bar for justification ‚Äì see the last justified answers thread for examples of what quality answers look like.
The purpose of giving models and data is to allow other people to build on your answer. Everyone can make arbitrary claims, but models and evidence allow for verification and dialogue.
The more concrete the explanation the better. Speculation is fine, uncertain models are fine; sources, explicit models and numbers for variables that other people can play with based on their own beliefs are excellent.
This thread is inspired by a post by Eliezer Yudkowsky which I'll reproduce below, in which Eliezer lists eight answers that this sort of post would come up with.
These are not justified to the standard of the thread, so you (you!) can get some easy karma by leaving an answer that justifies one of these with the sources/data/explanation needed to argue for it. It includes much of the discussion elsewhere on LW (e.g. by Wei Dai, Zvi, Robin, and others), so it shouldn't be hard to find the prior discussion.

278,3da9da33-8160-44a1-b4d5-e33e16a5bde0,viljami.virolainen,https://www.theverge.com/interface/2020/4/10/21215267/covid-19-contact-tracing-apps-bluetooth-coronavirus-flaws-public-health,Why Bluetooth apps are bad at discovering new cases of COVID-19,"Yesterday, we talked about the things that need to happen before we can begin to slowly re-open our cities: hospital bed supply catches up fully with demand; testing catches up fully with demand; we develop programs for quarantining new cases and informing their contacts that they may have been exposed to the disease; and the number of cases declines for 14 consecutive days.
Today let‚Äôs zoom in (not Zoom in) on the third point: building systems to enforce quarantine and to trace the contacts of those who get infected. Both are areas where public health officials believe that technology can play a role. But I want to describe why that role might be more limited than you assume ‚Äî and, according to the experts I‚Äôve spoken with, much less important than staffing up public health agencies to do the primary work.
First let‚Äôs talk about quarantine enforcement ‚Äî making sure that people the state has ordered to stay at home are actually doing so. This is an area where technology can play ‚Äî and is playing ‚Äî a huge role. I‚Äôve mentioned Taiwan‚Äôs ‚Äúelectronic fence‚Äù in this column a few times already, but here‚Äôs a quick refresher from Reuters:
The system monitors phone signals to alert police and local officials if those in home quarantine move away from their address or turn off their phones. Jyan said authorities will contact or visit those who trigger an alert within 15 minutes.
The technology here is not particularly complicated. With the cooperation of a telecom company, you can tie a person‚Äôs phone to a single cellular tower. If the phone pings another tower, or shuts off, the public health authorities contact you. This approach is invasive, somewhat disturbing, and by all accounts quite effective. It‚Äôs not clear to me how a similar program could be implemented without new legislation giving telecom companies explicit permission to share this kind of data ‚Äî my inbox is full of lawmakers (appropriately!) calling for safeguards and oversight on any such government surveillance. But if the recent stimulus packages are any indication, that also seems like legislation that could be written and passed very quickly.
Note that tech alone doesn‚Äôt solve the enforcement problem. You also need people calling patients whose phones appear to be moving or have been shut off. You need people doing spot checks to make sure the person under quarantine hasn‚Äôt simply left their phone at the house and gone to church. And you probably need a place to house quarantined people that is not with their families, which are the most likely places for the coronavirus to spread. Tech is necessary, in other words, but not sufficient.
Now let‚Äôs talk about what might be the most challenging piece in the entire stack: contact tracing. Public health experts tell me that getting in touch with people who may have been exposed to a known COVID-19 case is one of the most important steps we‚Äôll need to take to contain future outbreaks. But the how of it is complicated. While we‚Äôve seen a Cambrian explosion of contact tracing apps around the world, it remains unclear how good or effective any of them have been. And as US government officials consider asking big tech companies to consider working on contact tracing solutions ‚Äî and I‚Äôm told that they have already made inquiries with Facebook ‚Äî that‚Äôs worth keeping in mind.
To get a sense of how this played out in one country that has done a relatively good job containing the coronavirus outbreak, let‚Äôs turn to South Korea. Derek Thompson has a good piece on contact tracing in the Atlantic that describes how it has played out there. The country seemingly skipped over traditional contact tracing completely and went straight to putting new coronavirus victims on blast in the new public square ‚Äî other people‚Äôs smartphones:
The government uses several sources, such as cellphone-location data, CCTV, and credit-card records, to broadly monitor citizens‚Äô activity. When somebody tests positive, local governments can send out an alert, a bit like a flood warning, that reportedly includes the individual‚Äôs last name, sex, age, district of residence, and credit-card history, with a minute-to-minute record of their comings and goings from various local businesses. ‚ÄúIn some districts, public information includes which rooms of a building the person was in, when they visited a toilet, and whether or not they wore a mask,‚Äù Mark Zastrow, a reporter for Nature, wrote. ‚ÄúEven overnight stays at ‚Äòlove motels‚Äô have been noted.‚Äù New cases in South Korea have declined about 90 percent in the past 40 days, an extraordinary achievement. But the amount of information in South Korea‚Äôs tracing alerts has turned some of its citizens into imperious armchair detectives, who scour the internet in an attempt to identify people who test positive and condemn them online. Choi Young-ae, the chair of South Korea‚Äôs Human Rights Commission, has said that this harassment has made some Koreans less willing to be tested.
So far, South Korea appears to be an outlier in this approach. Other countries are opting to build much more targeted interventions, using phones‚Äô GPS and Bluetooth signals to passively track the proximity between individuals and inform potential contacts after someone gets infected. Singapore, which built an app called TraceTogether that monitors Bluetooth activity, ‚Äúoffers perhaps the most likely model for the West,‚Äù Thompson writes. The country is making TraceTogether available as an open-source project.
To the extent that they‚Äôve been written about to date, these passive tracking apps are generally considered in terms of their privacy implications. Who collects the data? Where does it get shared? Can it be linked back to individual patients? How long should that information be stored?
Already, various academics and entrepreneurs are working on passive tracking apps that attempt to solve these issues. At Wired, Andy Greenberg reviews three such efforts, and all of them are absolute Rube Goldberg machines. Here‚Äôs one of the apps under development:
Covid-Watch uses Bluetooth as a kind of proximity detector. The app constantly pings out Bluetooth signals to nearby phones, looking for others that might be running the app within about two meters, or six and a half feet. If two phones spend 15 minutes in range of each other, the app considers them to have had a ‚Äúcontact event.‚Äù They each generate a unique random number for that event, record the numbers, and transmit them to each other. If a Covid-Watch user later believes they‚Äôre infected with Covid-19, they can ask their health care provider for a unique confirmation code. (Covid-Watch would distribute those confirmation codes only to caregivers, to prevent spammers or faulty self-diagnoses from flooding the system with false positives.) When that confirmation code is entered, the app would upload all the contact event numbers from that phone to a server. The server would then send out those contact event numbers to every phone in the system, where the app would check if any of the codes matched their own log of contact events from the last two weeks. If any of the numbers match, the app alerts the user that they made contact with an infected person, and displays instructions or a video about getting tested or self-quarantining.
All of these efforts seem to skip over the question of whether a Bluetooth-reported ‚Äúcontact event‚Äù is an effective method of contact tracing to begin with. On Thursday I spoke with Dr. Farzad Mostashari, the former national coordinator for health information technology at the Department of Health and Human Services. (Today he‚Äôs the the CEO of Aledade, which makes management software for physicians.) Mostashari had recently posted a Twitter thread expressing skepticism over Bluetooth-based contact tracing, and I asked him to elaborate.
The first problem he described is getting a meaningful number of people to install the app and make sure it‚Äôs active as everyone makes their way through the world. Most countries have made app installation voluntary, and adoption has been low. In Singapore, Mostashari told me, adoption has been about 12 percent of the population. If the United States had similar adoption, you‚Äôve now made your big contact-tracing bet on the likelihood that two people passing one another have both installed this app on your phone. The statistical likelihood of this is about 1.44 percent. (It could be higher in areas with greater population density or where the app was more widely installed.)
The second problem is that when these Bluetooth chips do pass in the night, you should expect a large number of false positives.
‚ÄúIf I am in the wide open, my Bluetooth and your Bluetooth might ping each other even if you‚Äôre much more than six feet away,‚Äù Mostashari said. ‚ÄúYou could be through the wall from me in an apartment, and it could ping that we‚Äôre having a proximity event. You could be a on a different floor of the building and it could ping. You could be biking by me in the open air and it could ping.‚Äù
All of this seems really problematic even before you consider asking Apple or Google or Facebook to make a contact tracing app and promote it through their own channels. We‚Äôve spent three and a half years having a discussion about the shortcomings of these companies when it comes to protecting our data privacy; putting them in a position to oversee a project as intimate and sensitive as disease infection seems like a bad idea. (My own sense in talking from executives at Google and Facebook in recent days is that they are eager to help with crisis response, and are already doing so in various ways, but basically have no interest in this particular part of the response.)
So that leaves us with two remaining questions: what should Big Tech do, and what should the government do?
Public health experts I‚Äôve talked with have been enthusiastic about efforts from Facebook and Google to use aggregated, anonymized data to display movement patterns ‚Äî an important measure of the effectiveness of stay-at-home orders. They like Apple‚Äôs COVID-19 screening tool and Facebook‚Äôs collaboration with Carnegie Mellon University to encourage users to self-report symptoms ‚Äî to the university, not to Facebook. These projects won‚Äôt solve the crisis on their own, but they‚Äôre good and useful tools for giving public health officials something close to a real-time look at how the disease is spreading through communities. And if there are other tools that they can build ‚Äî particularly ones that rely on aggregated and anonymized data, rather than personally identifiable information ‚Äî I think companies should continue exploring them.
And what about the government? The good news is that our public health infrastructure already has a lot of practice with contact tracing, thanks to our dear old friend the sexually transmitted infection. Come down with HIV, chlamydia, or gonorrhea, and a good county health agency will work with you to contact anyone you may have exposed since becoming infected. (Here‚Äôs a good piece by Ryan Kost in the San Francisco Chronicle about how the city‚Äôs experience with HIV/AIDS in the 1980s led it to dramatically beef up its public health infrastructure, which contributed to its admirably quick response to the threat of COVID-19.)
Those same tactics ‚Äî public health investigators making phone calls and working out in the community ‚Äî seem to be the most effective tool we have for contact tracing. And the good news is that savvy public health departments ‚Äî like San Francisco‚Äôs ‚Äî are already ramping up. Here‚Äôs James Temple in the MIT Tech Review on what he describes as one of the first such efforts in the country:
The Department of Public Health is supplementing its own staff with city librarians and dozens of researchers, medical students, and others from the University of California, San Francisco. City health workers have already been contact tracing on a small level, but they plan to significantly scale up the effort over the next few weeks. The team includes about 40 people and could rise as high as 150. The task force will interview every patient who tests positive and provide necessary support to ensure that all are completely isolating themselves, down to helping them find and get to shelter if necessary. They also expect to reach out to between three and five people that patients came into contact with in the preceding days. They‚Äôll alert them they may have been exposed, ask them to limit their contacts, and either encourage them to go in for a test or bring one to them. Those who test positive will trigger additional rounds of interviews and contact tracing.
Experts I‚Äôve spoken to say that there are software tools that could help public health workers: a website or app where people affected by COVID-19 can voluntarily upload their contacts, for example, making tracing easier for the health department. But you still need people to contact them.
Tom Frieden, a former director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told me a story to illustrate this point. Earlier in his career, when he was working on disease prevention with the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, his team was tracking a young man who suffered from drug-resistant tuberculosis. The man wound up in juvenile detention, but then escaped. He had no cell phone to trace. But Frieden dispatched a team to find him, and eventually succeeded and got him into treatment.
The point was that you cannot design a Bluetooth app that finds this man.
But you can hire people to find him. Frieden says we will need an extraordinary amount of people ‚Äî as many as 300,000, he says. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre talking about something like a hundred-fold increase in public health capacity,‚Äù Frieden said. ‚ÄúA lot of it can be done by phone banking. But a lot of it involves going out there and knocking on doors.‚Äù
The ‚Äúgood‚Äù news is that there are a lot of people who are recently out of work and may be considering new career opportunities. It seems like one of the best ways we could spend stimulus money is in helping state and county health programs expand their capacity to hire people for contact tracing.
And we can keep exploring new tech-driven solutions for contact tracing, too. But for now it seems worth saying that there‚Äôs little evidence that phones are good at contact tracing ‚Äî and a lot of evidence that human beings are. As we prepare to begin re-opening society, the biggest investment we need to make is in people.

Governing
‚≠ê The politics of 2020 now look much less ominous for Big Tech. The combination of changing priorities due to the coronavirus pandemic, along with critics like Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren dropping out of the presidential race, mean the techlash has largely faded away. Here‚Äôs Eric Newcomer at Bloomberg:
Biden‚Äôs attacks have never provoked the concerns as those from Sanders and Warren. He has deep ties to the tech industry; his former director of communications, Jay Carney, is now Amazon‚Äôs top spokesman. Biden has also repeatedly framed his administration as a continuation of the Obama years, and several former Obama officials have set up shop in Silicon Valley. While the tech industry rank-and-file mostly donated to the industry‚Äôs antagonists, its executives seemed most excited about younger moderates Pete Buttigieg and Cory Booker.

287,a0f88d87-5403-4314-bc52-f57d86c3f2e2,viljami.virolainen,https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/10/21216484/google-apple-coronavirus-contract-tracing-bluetooth-location-tracking-data-app,Apple and Google are building a coronavirus tracking system into iOS and Android,"On Friday, Apple and Google announced a system for tracking the spread of the new coronavirus, allowing users to share data through Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) transmissions and approved apps from health organizations.
The new system, which is laid out in a series of documents and white papers, would use short-range Bluetooth communications to establish a voluntary contact-tracing network, keeping extensive data on phones that have been in close proximity with each other. Official apps from public health authorities will get access to this data, and users who download them can report if they‚Äôve been diagnosed with COVID-19. The system will also alert people who download them to whether they were in close contact with an infected person.
Apple and Google will introduce a pair of iOS and Android APIs in mid-May and make sure these health authorities‚Äô apps can implement them. During this phase, users will still have to download an app to participate in contact-tracing, which could limit adoption. But in the months after the API is complete, the companies will work on building tracing functionality into the underlying operating system, as an option immediately available to everyone with an iOS or Android phone.
Contact tracing ‚Äî which involves figuring out who an infected person has been in contact with and trying to prevent them from infecting others ‚Äî is one of the most promising solutions for containing COVID-19, but using digital surveillance technology to do it raises massive privacy concerns and questions about effectiveness. Earlier this week, the American Civil Liberties Union raised concerns about tracking users with phone data, arguing that any system would need to be limited in scope and avoid compromising user privacy.
Unlike some other methods ‚Äî like, say, using GPS data ‚Äî this Bluetooth plan wouldn‚Äôt track people‚Äôs physical location. It would basically pick up the signals of nearby phones at 5-minute intervals and store the connections between them in a database. If one person tests positive for the novel coronavirus, they could tell the app they‚Äôve been infected, and it could notify other people whose phones passed within close range in the preceding days.
To help public health officials slow the spread of #COVID19, Google & @Apple are working on a contact tracing approach designed with strong controls and protections for user privacy. @tim_cook and I are committed to working together on these efforts.https://t.co/T0j88YBcFu ‚Äî Sundar Pichai (@sundarpichai) April 10, 2020
The system also takes a number of steps to prevent people from being identified, even after they‚Äôve shared their data. While the app regularly sends information out over Bluetooth, it broadcasts an anonymous key rather than a static identity, and those keys cycle every 15 minutes to preserve privacy. Even once a person shares that they‚Äôve been infected, the app will only share keys from the specific period in which they were contagious.
Crucially, there is no centrally accessible master list of which phones have matched, contagious or otherwise. That‚Äôs because the phones themselves are performing the cryptographic calculations required to protect privacy. The central servers only maintain the database of shared keys, rather than the interactions between those keys.
Contact tracing can help slow the spread of COVID-19 and can be done without compromising user privacy. We‚Äôre working with @sundarpichai & @Google to help health officials harness Bluetooth technology in a way that also respects transparency & consent. https://t.co/94XlbmaGZV ‚Äî Tim Cook (@tim_cook) April 10, 2020
The method still has potential weaknesses. In crowded areas, it could flag people in adjacent rooms who aren‚Äôt actually sharing space with the user, making people worry unnecessarily. It may also not capture the nuance of how long someone was exposed ‚Äî working next to an infected person all day, for example, will expose you to a much greater viral load than walking by them on the street. And it depends on people having apps in the short term and up-to-date smartphones in the long term, which could mean it‚Äôs less effective in areas with lower connectivity.
It‚Äôs also a relatively new program, and Apple and Google are still talking to public health authorities and other stakeholders about how to run it. This system probably can‚Äôt replace old-fashioned methods of contact tracing ‚Äî which involve interviewing infected people about where they‚Äôve been and who they‚Äôve spent time with ‚Äî but it could offer a high-tech supplement using a device that billions of people already own.","['Russell Brandom Adi Robertson', 'Russell Brandom', 'Adi Robertson', 'Apr']",2020-04-10 12:58:56

Being a well-known Silicon Valley unicorn, Slack is a melting pot of top-notch functionality and versatility. However, when innovation constantly breeds further innovation, we can forget that less is more. Slack offers way more features than your company may want to deal with, which turns your team‚Äôs chat into a long and winding road.
The second reason you might want to explore Slack alternatives is the cost ‚Äî $8 per user when billed monthly. That adds up, especially for small teams and startups with limited resources.
Whatever your reason, there is an ocean of business communication tools out there your team can benefit from. Some are free and offer more options than Slack‚Äôs basic plan. Some don‚Äôt restrict your message limit. Some allow you to host them on your own server.
Long story short, let‚Äôs take a look at the list of the best Slack alternatives we‚Äôve put together for you. Hangouts Chat Chanty Microsoft Teams Rocket.Chat Discord Mattermost Flock Ryver Flowdock Wire Fleep
Source
Hangouts Chat features virtual rooms that hold up to 8,000 people. As you can imagine, it has direct messaging, threaded conversations, and bots that integrate with G Suite apps as well as third-party companies. It also works with 28 different languages. What‚Äôs more, Hangouts Chat will focus on AI and use machine learning to find out what users might need: book meetings, find files, and ‚Äúmore‚Äù as Google says.
Hangouts Chat isn‚Äôt free, but it is cheaper than Slack. To gain access, you should purchase a corporate G Suite account, which starts at $6 per user, per month.
Source
Chanty is a free, simple, and intuitive team chat for small- to medium-sized teams with unlimited, searchable message history. The tool features traditional chat functionality like public, private, and one-to-one conversations.
Speaking of Chanty‚Äôs setup, it organizes all of your files, links, tasks, and messages into folders in a feature called Teambook. But what you may fall in love with is Chanty‚Äôs thorough onboarding process (which is especially useful if your team includes non-techies).

If you have access to a Microsoft Office 365 plan, then you can already use Microsoft Teams. Alternatively, you can start with the freemium version of the tool for up to 300 users. The free plan includes all the essential team chat features: instant messaging, audio and video calls, and integrations.
Speaking of storage, here you are limited to 2GB per user and 10GB shared among your team. The paid version starts at $5 per user, per month and offers more storage and features, such as scheduled meetings and meeting recording.

Rocket.Chat is a free, open-source, and fully customizable Slack alternative designed for anyone who wants to host their own chat service. Besides chat functionality, it has some other great features. First, it is super easy to migrate to Rocket.Chat. Export your files from Slack ‚Äî and voila! What‚Äôs more, the tool offers real-time automatic translation of more than 50 languages as well as voice messages and end-to-end encryption.
If you experience issues deploying Rocket.Chat, the Brazil-based team chat tool offers a cloud solution starting at $3 per user.
Source
Discord is free and the most popular team communication app for gamers. The platform provides users with familiar Slack-like UI, Skype-like video, and voice chats. Discord is amazing to use while participating in a Dota 2 battle, but it also meets collaboration challenges many companies face.
The tool divides channels by text and voice. Nevertheless, users can seamlessly switch to more common private and public channels. It‚Äôs worth mentioning that Discord doesn‚Äôt offer integrations with apps you might use at work. So this tool will be a good choice for you if your team doesn‚Äôt need anything beyond text, voice, or video communication. It‚Äòs also the only chat in this list that offers push-to-talk features and the Instant Invite link that lets you share a chat server with anyone.
Discord is free for a full set of features. But if you‚Äôd like to have custom emoji, larger file uploads, and GIF avatars in your team chat, join the paid plan for $4.99 per month.

If you‚Äôre searching for a private cloud, open-source, and highly customizable communication tool, Mattermost is all you need. Despite the fact the messenger mostly targets enterprise companies, Mattermost offers a free version for smaller teams with unlimited message history, integrations, and multi-language support.
Paid plans offer endless customization options and better security, starting at $39 per user, per year. Keep in mind that you must have at least 10 users to purchase Mattermost.

Flock is a team messenger that claims to work faster than Slack. The tool offers a freemium version that includes up to 10,000 searchable messages, video conferencing calls for up to four users for 20 minutes, and the ability to connect Flock to more than 50 apps. What‚Äôs more, here you can turn messages into tasks and add due dates to them.
Among other Flock features, you will find guest accounts, one-way announcement channels, and a five-column interface. Paid plans start from $4.50 per user, per month and unlock handy features like screen sharing, unlimited message history, and 10GB file storage per user.

Ryver is a Trello-like team communication tool with a built-in task manager. Just imagine kanban boards integrated with open forums, private groups, and one-to-one conversations. Then pepper it with voice and video calls for up to 400 people, and integrations through a Zapier account, and you have Ryver.
Speaking of pricing, this team messenger comes with a 14-day trial (no freemium plan). The cost starts at $49 per month for up to 12 users or $99 per month for unlimited users.

Flowdock is a team chat tool where all conversations are marked by colored threads to keep the navigation between topics seamless. Here you can make video calls through appeair.in, and you have access to more than 100 integrations. Notifications from these third-party services drop into the so-called ‚ÄúIntegration inbox‚Äù to keep conversations focused.
Flowdock is free for up to five users. The paid plan starts at $3 per user, per month.

Wire is a secure collaboration platform that features one-to-one conversations, group chats, HD video calls, and video conferences. It comes with end-to-end encryption and stands out with its security. In addition to the common functionality, like file and screen sharing, Wire‚Äôs unique features include self-destructing messages and quick image editing right in the chat. The price starts at ‚Ç¨4 per user, per month.

Unlike other Slack alternatives, Fleep is an open network, so you can communicate with anyone else on Fleep. As a result, the app bridges the gap between an inbox and a business messenger. Fleep integrates emails with its own chat system, which can be especially handy if you need to be a member of several teams.
Fleep is absolutely free to use and features unlimited message history and integrations in its free plan. But if you require admin controls over your team accounts, the upgrade will cost you ‚Ç¨5 per user, per month.",['Julia Samoilenko'],
289,744458ab-08f3-480a-a4e2-4669ef0ec529,viljami.virolainen,https://www.goodfirms.co/blog/the-best-slack-alternatives,what are the best slack alternatives,"Modern day communications have reached new heights. Online communication tools are the momentum in every business globally these days. Team chat is something that more and more companies are trying to incorporate within their workplace. Some of the best collaboration software solutions today are dominating the digital communication realm and are complementing the exchange of next-generation ideas. Slack is one such powerful tool. Is Slack the only one ruling the market? Are there any alternatives to Slack? Can the best Slack alternatives act as the super-connectors? Can free alternatives to Slack help the start-ups to collaborate effectively? Let us discuss this in detail in the following sections of this article.
The Slack Company was started back in 2013 by Stewart Butterfield, who was in great need of a communication and collaboration tool inside of his company. What began as an internal-use-only idea developed and expanded into one of the hottest startups of 2015 and one of the most used communication tools in 2018. Some major security breaches in 2015 made Butterfield reconsider the functionality and security of this product making it one of the most important collaboration tools existing in 2019. Yet, if you are at the parting of the ways and rushing about selecting something except for Slack, then it is essential first to clarify what Slack is and why it is so much beloved by its users.
The phenomenon of Slack was in its novelty at the time of emergence and its continuous improvement and enhancement as time goes. What started as a basic communication space has transformed into a fully functional collaboration tool not only for small teams but for large businesses and a wide number of non-Slack users as well.
Today, Slack has taken the top position in the collaboration software market. Slack allows not only to communicate inside of the desktop/phone app or webpage version but also share any kinds of files, use external tools (more than 1,500 available for integration), install extensions and even create your own enhancement tools for easier cooperation inside your company or team.
Most of all, people are in love with Slack because it has a number of essential features required for the effective running of the daily business processes. Here are the most important of them:
Channels cooperation: Yes, channel usage is not new in 2019. Yet, in Slack one has all channels in the same table of contents and the ease of switching among them. Any user can search for any information located inside of those channels. Channels come in two forms: shared and private; the latter was designed for private discussions while the former can include as many members as needed.
Audio and video calls: What Facebook just recently applied has been available in Slack for ages. Audio and video calls facilitate internal and external cooperation of the company‚Äôs members and teams.
External apps integration: Whenever someone posts a document on Slack, others get access to it instantly. An image shared on the channel becomes open for alternation for all channel members. The possibility to exchange a wide range of files and integrate all possible functionalities into the collaboration process is what Slack offers to its users.
All-in-one space: Integration of Slack with a number of external apps (such as Google Drive, or DropBox) and services allows not clicking between the tabs and hence save a lot of working time. There is no need to update the links or open external pages since all possible services one may need are already available within the Slack space.

The benefits Slack offers definitely pay off! Recent statistics indicate that the number of daily active free Slack users worldwide has risen from 16,000 to 8,000,000 in four years. The number proves the efficiency of the service without a doubt.
But the free users may only be on the test-run to check what the service has to offer while the number of paid users, which is 3,000,000 proves the point ‚Äì Slack knows what it is doing and the growth from zero to 3 million paid users proves the point.
Even though Slack was brought up in San Francisco, nearly half of its active users come from outside North America, namely top foreign markets like France, Germany, Great Britain, Japan, and Australia.

Why Search for a Slack Alternative?
If Slack is such a great service to work with, then why seek for alternatives to slack?
Well, most users still remember about the security breach that happened to the service back in 2015. And such an issue still raises a lot of concerns among the currently active users. Some also complain about the lack of project management tools integrated into the platform and insist that it is essential for them to be integrated into the service in the future.
Another common problem of Slack is space. The desktop application requires pretty a lot of storage space. Such a problem becomes an issue for small businesses who do not possess large storage disks on all computers used inside of a company.
And one more dig at Slack is its pricing policy. The current state of affairs offers $8 per active user per month provided that you pay monthly; if you would like to save, you can get billing information annually and then pay only $6.67 for the same features in the Standard services package.
While the pricing seems not high enough, for a small business of 30 employees, a company will need to pay $2,401.2 in total for the Standard package and $4,500 for the Plus package, provided that the billing comes once a year. The numbers still do not seem to be too high, but for a small business, this might be a pretty expensive investment to make.
What are the Best Slack Alternatives?
There is a wide range of Slack alternatives available in the market. Some of them might look completely identical to the original tool, except for the design, while others cover the holes of the Slack‚Äôs functionality. The list you will see below does not claim the apps and tools listed are the ideal ones for your particular business; however, in terms of functionalities, they can and do create strong competition in the market of communication tools.
Mattermost is one of the closest friends and rivals of Slack but can be the best alternatives to slack. It has similar design and functionality with a couple of definitive features
In comparison to Slack, Mattermost does not limit the messages history. If Slack offers only 10,000 messages in a free plan, Mattermost keeps them all for your team‚Äôs working needs, whether you are paying for the service or not. Besides that, the pricing policy of this service is much more generous and affordable even for small businesses since payment is $39 per user per year (which makes it $3.25 in comparison to Slack‚Äôs $6.67/$8 charges).
The full-service quote is, however, not available on the website and the management needs you to write more about your requirements to offer you a quote. The important trick here is that only businesses that have 10 users or more can purchase paid plans with Mattermost.

Key features (as opposed to Slack):
Slack-compatible yet self-hosted: Mattermost is compatible with the existing integrations of Slack. This means that anything you have on Slack can easily be transferred to Mattermost, such as users, teams, public channel history, etc. However, hosting the solution on your own server will not cost you a penny which is not even possible for Slack users.
All shapes and forms: Mattermost is not just an online solution. It also has iOS/Android mobile apps and desktop apps for Windows, Linux, and Mac.
Open source: If you need any customization or changes to be made to this communication tool, you are free to go!
If you need any customization or changes to be made to this communication tool, you are free to go! Ease of installation and maintenance: While Slack required a lot of free space on a device, Mattermost keeps everything tight and functional. Users can check a detailed explanation of how much space is needed for running different sizes of business on their official webpage.

Security: It is still not perfect with Mattermost, yet the levels are much higher than the ones of Slack (for instance, it is secured behind the user‚Äôs firewall). Mattermost is a service which complied with the latest consumer data protection and GDPR acts.
#2. Rocket.Chat - Free, Open Source, Enterprise Team Chat
Rocket.Chat, in contrast to Slack, is an open source Slack alternative that can be perfectly customized to your business needs. The look and feel of this team chatting solution is adaptive to any requirements you might have.
Since you are looking for an alternative to Slack, chances are you will need to transfer all your data from Slack to the new platform. Well, Rocket.Chat offers a perfect exporting system that leaves all your Slack groundwork in place. All you need is to export the required files from Slack and upload them to Rocket.Chat in just a few clicks.
The cost of Rocket.Chat can battle the Slack‚Äôs offer. There is a free option available for everyone. The free package is advised for no more than 1k users and offers all essential features in terms of functionality but does not include any support. The paid packages of Rocket.Chat begin from $3 per user per month if paid monthly and $30 per user in total in the case of the yearly billing system. The Pro package has negotiable prices and attractive discounts for large corporations. The paid packages include personal assistance for migration, 24/7 support, and some administrative perks.

Translations: This is a particularly important feature for companies working with international clients daily. Rocket.Chat has a built-in automatic translation in more than 35 languages. Slack in its turn requires a separate plug-in to do such magic.

Slack in its turn requires a separate plug-in to do such magic. Updates and compensations for the lacking: The greatest advantage of the open-source platforms is that whenever you are missing a feature, you can request it on GitHub and get it developed for you personally. Since Rocket.Chat is among the best and most popular chat solutions, there are more than 850 developers contributing to this project. Moreover, all updates with Rocket.Chat are free of charge.

Security: Rocket.Chat‚Äôs security uses E2E encryption to guarantee the safest storage of all your data and the absence of breaches in the security shell of your business communication. Besides that, the service runs its Vulnerability Disclosure Program and encourages anyone to point out the security susceptibility so they can improve the service.
Fleep is more than just a messenger. This is a bridge between emails and chats. The service allows sending messages to any person registered there; all you need to know is their email. Fleep is not about closed systems like channels; it is an open net where everyone can connect to everyone. Such an approach significantly facilitates communication, especially for international and large-scale corporate teams.
The perfect openness in the Fleep world, however, costs money. Yes, this communication software is still cheaper than Slack (‚Ç¨5 [about $5.7] per user per month in contrast to the well-known $6.67), yet it costs more than the previously mentioned Slack alternatives. Fleep can be yet another powerful alternative to Slack.

Key Features (in contrast to Slack):
All in one place: Slack requires a user to have multiple accounts to be a part of multiple projects. In Fleep it is all in one. One registration, one account, numerous projects, and unlimited connections ‚Äî this is all about free and open communication in a single ecosystem.

Unlimited messages: Remember that Slack does limit the messages history? Well, just as Mattermost or Rocket.Chat, Fleep does not make such a mistake. All of your messages will be available to you at all time. However, keep in mind that the storage space for the file-sharing feature is heavily limited by Fleep which might be a great limitation for large teams (in the free package you get only 10 GB which is even less than on Gmail).

Monolog messages: This is a feature everyone loves on Facebook, and Fleep has integrated it into its system. Here one can write messages to themselves to keep track of the current thoughts. The downside of it, however, is that you can create an unlimited number of mono-threads and eventually get lost in the layers of your self-centered messages.

File drawer: On Slack, you are likely to install or add integrated file-management systems in order to work efficiently. Yet still, you will need to click between them to find the file you sent 50 messages ago. Fleep has a file drawer which storages all attachments that were sent within a thread by all its members. It helps in getting faster access to the required files.
#4. Ryver: Group Chat + Task Manager + Workflow Automation IN ONE APP
Ryver is about combining communication inside of a team with the management features. The idea of having both communication and management definitely wins over the market. Since management frequently involves sharing of many documents and spreads, there are several built-in integrations, such as Google Drive, or DropBox to share the files from your own storage space directly inside the app.
Ryver‚Äôs motto says that it is ‚ÄúThe Best Way to Communicate.‚Äù Ryver is not free! Ryver‚Äôs payment plans for the simplest package begin from $49 per month per 12 users. Yes, it is $4.08 per user per month, yet it is still paid! The middle package costs $99 per month with the unlimited number of users and the Pro offer starts at $399 per month. The pricing policy here suggests that Ryver is a possible solution for established corporations but not an alternative for start-ups and small businesses.
Source: Ryver
Key Features (in contrast to Slack):
Enormous integrations: This feature of Ryver is very close to the Slack in its core. However, Ryver involves the assistance of Zapier and offers 500+ integration. The trick is in Zapier; it allows users to receive no more than 100 tasks in the free package. This means that if your team needs a lot of integrations on a daily basis, you will have to pay for Zapier on top (which is about $250 for 50k tasks). So what was announced as a free communication tool ends up requiring investments.

So what was announced as a free communication tool ends up requiring investments. Intuitive design: This is yet another loud phrase from the internet. Yes, Ryver struggles to offer intuitive design, yet so far it fails. The buttons and user journey is not intuitive enough and upon the first acquaintance with the solution, one may get lost.

The buttons and user journey is not intuitive enough and upon the first acquaintance with the solution, one may get lost. Management from the message view: This is the feature Ryver is beloved for. Right from the message view, one can create a task, set a reminder in a calendar, add a reaction, start a new topic, or edit/delete/reply to another message. Management of the workflow and monitoring of others performance becomes easy and neat with Ryver regardless of your skills set.
The above-mentioned points clearly justify the fact that Ryver can be positioned among the top best alternative to Slack.
#5. Flock ‚Äì A perfect Communication and Collaboration Platform for Teams of any size
Flock appeared in the market right after Slack, back in 2014. While it mostly talked about as an app, the service also offers an online platform for those not willing to download an app. The company mainly presents itself as an irreplaceable helper for the HR department to onboard new employees and monitor/manage the work of the current staff.
In the past, Flock‚Äôs advantage was unlimited messages history in contrast to Slack. Yet today, their free package does have a limit of 10k messages (just like Slack does). The second offer is called Pro and costs $4 per user per month if billed yearly and $6 if billed monthly. Again, the Enterprise prices vary and require direct contact with the company. The limit of storage space, which was present in Fleep, is also an unpleasant piece of news for those managing large files daily.
Key Features (in contrast to Slack):
Speed: Flock explicitly demonstrates that its loading time and file sharing speed is better than Slack‚Äôs. And this is a great advantage unless you love being held by the app while performing your daily tasks.
Search: Searching inside of the app is amazing with Flock. You can search for people, messages, any piece of information without leaving your current thread or view. However, users report having too many columns while using the search feature in this solution. With Flock, you can get up to 5 vertical columns with information.
Interface language: The developers introduced complete interface translations into Spanish and Portuguese, which can be a great perk for teams in need of a translated interface.
Security: Security precautions taken by Flock are also better than the ones of Slack. The service offers TLS 1.2 data encryption and hosting of all the information in the secure cloud of Amazon Web Services (AWS). The enhanced mechanisms allow for controlling data access and user rights among all active members.

The service offers TLS 1.2 data encryption and hosting of all the information in the secure cloud of Amazon Web Services (AWS). The enhanced mechanisms allow for controlling data access and user rights among all active members. Inside tools: While being inside of a messaging part of the app, you get a number of built-in features like calendar, to-do lists, deadlines, polls and many more to create direct tasks for the team members and not need to use a number of additional tools.
The bottom line
The above-listed software solutions are the most commonly named alternatives to Slack. Some of them are free alternatives to slack, and some are open source slack alternatives. Some are truly worth your attention while others just have a well-known name. Note that the market is filled with other great solutions, such as Bitrix, Mostra, Glip, or Wire. These solutions did not get on our list only because they are not entirely communication tool but rather something greater and, probably, complex for you. Troop Messenger, Trello, Asana, Kezmo, Rainbow are other collaboration software solutions that you can consider.
The market of communication tools continues to evolve, mutate, and progress every day. Remember that new apps and solutions appear daily and many of them can offer even a greater functional spectrum if compared to the established communication and collaboration tools. The world will continue to integrate communication in the form of chats with emails, social media platforms, and management tools to deliver the hybrids to facilitate the workflow and its handling for companies of all sizes. So keep an eye on the innovative collaboration software solutions and dare to try something new!

Over 11,000 executives from 124 countries participated in the global survey, including 354 South African business and HR leaders. These professionals offered insights into the future of work and human capital‚Äôs valuable role in shaping it.
A key focus of the report identified which communication platforms South African employees and businesses were moving towards over the next 3-5 years.
Up to 70% of global respondents believe workers will spend more time on collaboration platforms in the future (such as Slack), while 67 % see growth in ‚Äúwork-based social media‚Äù, and 62% predict an increase in instant messaging.
When looking at the local data however, the overall findings show that most respondents use email and phone for personal and professional communication ‚Äì probably because they are more familiar with these technologies.
Communication channels regularly used for personal/professional communication showed that 94% of respondents say that email is the most commonly used communication channel for professionals, with 78% using email for personal communication.
Even though there are many new technologies available, only a small percentage of local respondents said they will consider using social messaging and online collaboration tools in the next three to five years.

The global findings showed that face-to-face meetings and phone meetings are on the decline, while work collaboration platforms are on the rise. Their overall preference remains face-to-face and telephonic communication.
In contrast, South African companies expect face to face meetings to increase, alongside other more traditional forms of communication such as e-mail, texting and phoning.
Deloitte also noted that many local organisations only consider implementing new technologies or software tools once these have been approved by their Information Technology (IT) department.
‚ÄúIt is clear that IT and HR are the primary drivers of new communication channels and connected work tools; however, only 14 % of organisations allow employees to use emerging channels,‚Äù it said.
‚ÄúThis could be because of IT security protocols in place, budgetary constraints, or lack of awareness of the new tools and platforms available,‚Äù Deloitte said.
In addition, 36% of respondents said that they only permit the use of well-established communication/collaboration tools, while only 14.5% allow employees to use emerging communication channels and tools freely.

291,744458ab-08f3-480a-a4e2-4669ef0ec529,viljami.virolainen,https://digiday.com/media/le-monde-uses-whatsapp-reach-african-readers/,How Le Monde uses Whatsapp to reach African readers,"Facebook may have restricted the list size that publishers can broadcast WhatsApp messages to, but French newspaper Le Monde is using the status feature to reach new readers in French-speaking African countries.
Since December, African-focused edition Le Monde Afrique has grown to 10,000 WhatsApp followers by posting content to its WhatsApp status, a similar feature to Instagram Stories. It typically posts three or four times a day and content lasts 24 hours. Le Monde has two staffers working on publishing content this WhatsApp channel and growing the community.
Depending on the day, around 20% of its followers will view the WhatsApp status content. That‚Äôs relatively high compared with the percentage of people who view its Instagram Stories, according to Le Monde. On Instagram is has nearly 1 million followers.
The French news publisher first used WhatsApp in November 2018 to grow its audience in African countries like Morocco, Senegal and the Ivory Coast. In France, Le Monde has 235,000 digital subscribers and 9.1 million monthly unique users in December, according to Comscore. Le Monde has 35 journalists in France and in the field covering countries in Africa.
‚ÄúWe wanted to reach countries where there are a lot of French speakers and Le Monde doesn‚Äôt have a big presence,‚Äù said Julie Leli√®vre, editorial and audience development project manager. ‚ÄúIn these specific countries, people do not consume as we do. In order to build audiences we need to adapt how we send our information.‚Äù
WhatsApp has become a primary network to discuss and share news in non-Western countries, according to Reuters Digital News Report. In 2019, 16% of people surveyed use WhatsApp each week for news, compared with 36% who use Facebook. In non-Western countries the number of people using WhatsApp is much higher where internet connection is primarily through phones. WhatsApp as a news source has been growing since Facebook changed its algorithm in 2018. The intimate nature of the platform and users‚Äô wish to communicate in private groups rather than on newsfeeds means that publishers and brands like Adidas are working out their voice on the platform.
Le Monde had previously grown its WhatsApp following to 40,000 but had to start from scratch in December when Facebook reduced the list size people can broadcast out down to 250 people in an effort to crack down on the spread of misinformation during elections in Brazil and India.
Anyone who has that number saved can see Le Monde‚Äôs WhatsApp status. One issue with posting on its status rather than broadcasting is that people don‚Äôt get a notification when it‚Äôs updated, so the number of people viewing its content naturally falls. On the flip side, Le Monde can re-use this content on its Instagram Stories too.
Publishers had known since July 2019 of Facebook‚Äôs plans to nix wider broadcasting on the platform so Le Monde had some time to evaluate how else to foster the community it built. The publisher asked followers how else they wanted the service to continue. This led to launching on Telegram too, where it sends out three articles every night and has grown to 2,000 followers.
Using WhatsApp has gone in and out of favor with publishers. Media owners like The Guardian, Axel Springer and the Financial Times experimented on the platform three years ago. Many wound these down as the maintaining lists and publishing to the platform became more manual and Facebook imposed more restrictions.
For now, Le Monde is not looking to turn its WhatsApp followers into subscribers.
‚ÄúThe first goal is to grow audiences on our site and for people to know and like us,‚Äù said Leli√®vre. ‚ÄúThe second goal is we would like to drive subscribers but we‚Äôre not sure yet how that would work.‚Äù

expert reaction to updated report on patients critically ill in intensive care with COVID-19, as published on Saturday by ICNARC (Intensive Care National Audit & Research Centre)
The Intensive Care National Audit & Research Centre (ICNARC), has published an updated report on patients in intensive care who are critically ill with COVID-19.
Prof Duncan Young, Professor of Intensive Care Medicine, University of Oxford, said:
‚ÄúBy midday on the 3rd April ICNARC had recorded 2621 admissions of patients with COVID-19 infections to ICUs in England, Wales and Norther Ireland. The majority are still being treated in an ICU.
‚ÄúAs in the previous report the patients are predominantly male (73%), with an average age of 60. The largest number of cases are still in London, Thames Valley and South-east regions.
‚ÄúWe only know the outcome (alive/dead) for a small proportion of those admitted to an ICU, so we can‚Äôt necessarily generalise these findings to what might happen to those admitted to an ICU in the future.
‚ÄúThe number of patients who have left ICU has increased quite considerably since the last report. Data are available on 690 discharges. Of these half were discharged alive and half died on the ICU. Data are available on a smaller number of discharged patients (388) who had required treatment with a ventilator (artificial ventilation). Only a third of these patients survived to leave an ICU. ICNARC supplies comparator data for non-COVID-19 viral pneumonia where the mortality of patients treated in an ICU was 22%. In general patients with the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which causes a similar deterioration in lung function requiring artificial ventilation, have less than 20% mortality.
‚ÄúThe relative ineffectiveness of artificial ventilation might suggest that COVID-19 causes a particularly treatment-resistant form of pneumonitis. It is also possible that in some patients COVID-19 is causing multi-organ failure of which the respiratory failure is the presenting problem but may not always be the cause of death ‚Äì but there are no data on this yet.
‚ÄúThe majority of the cases reported here are still being treated in ICUs, and the ICNARC report contains appropriate cautions on interpreting outcome and treatment data. ICNARC only looks at patients who become critically ill with COVID-19, not those many others who have mild symptoms managed at home.‚Äù

Anybody can get sick in this pandemic. But different people have different risks of getting severe symptoms that require hospitalization or intensive care ‚Äî and the chances of dying from Covid-19 vary widely across age groups.
The conventional wisdom says kids and young people may be fine even if they get infected, with the risk of a case being more severe increasing with age. It‚Äôs the older folks, we need to worry about, this thinking says, given death rates reach 20 percent or more among people 80 and older. Public health experts have seemed exasperated by the social media images of younger Americans who continue to socialize or even take a spring break vacation, worried that the perception a young person has little to fear from the coronavirus has given them a false sense of security.
To be clear, nobody should feel invulnerable to the coronavirus. Young people are going to contract the disease, a not-insignificant percentage of them are going to get very sick, and a smaller number will die. The rates of severe and deadly cases might not be nearly as high as the older generations that we are worried about, but the data already show that age alone does not make you invincible.
There are two other things about risk to keep in mind about who‚Äôs at higher risk. One, there is some indication that men could be at a higher risk of severe symptoms and death than women. In the initial Wuhan, China, outbreak, for example, men were dying at a notably higher rate than women. We‚Äôve seen the same trend in Italy. But we will need more research and data to be sure about the effect of gender on a patient‚Äôs prognosis.
Second, we know that people who have underlying medical conditions face higher odds of getting really sick or dying from Covid-19, particularly those with heart disease, diabetes, high blood pressure, lung disease, and cancer. Having one or more of those conditions increases a person‚Äôs risk of severe symptoms beyond what their age alone would suggest.
To review everything we know on age and the Covid-19 risk, I‚Äôm going to draw from a few sources that we‚Äôll keep coming back to: the World Health Organization report on the initial Wuhan outbreak, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention‚Äôs new report on the early cases in the US, Spain‚Äôs breakdown of its pandemic by age group, and two Vox articles on the risks to children and older people.
One caveat: Overall infection rates increase with age (kids seeing lower infection rates, seniors higher). But it‚Äôs hard to know if that‚Äôs because young people actually get infected less or simply because they are less likely to develop serious symptoms and seek medical attention, and so their cases are being underreported. A second caveat: The data we have so far are preliminary, and what we know will change as more information from different countries‚Äô outbreaks come in.
We‚Äôll therefore stick to the data we have both good numerators and denominators for to answer an important question: What are your risks if you do get infected with the coronavirus?
Now let‚Äôs run through the different age groups and what we know about their risks.
Kids under 10 years old
The important stats on our youngest:
In Spain (with 28,600 total cases as of March 21, nearly as many as America‚Äôs 31,000), 34 out of the 129 cases among children 0 to 9 years old resulted in hospitalization, a rate of 26 percent; one child was put in the ICU (a 0.8 percent rate); and there have been no fatalities.
Across Italy, South Korea, and China, there have so far been no reported fatalities among children under 10 years old, according to data compiled from public sources by the widely followed anonymous biotech investor and former scientist who goes by AndyBiotech on Twitter.
#COVID19 Crude case fatality rate age distribution chart updated with Spain data
(Wish can add CDC prelim data here too only if they also use decade cutoff like everyone else...) pic.twitter.com/IpoRrL7p6i ‚Äî Andy Biotech (@AndyBiotech) March 22, 2020
In the United States, there had been no ICU admittances or deaths reported among people under age 20 as of late last week; only a small percentage (1.6 percent) had been hospitalized. (I am using the lower bound of the CDC estimates because they cover all reported US cases, to be consistent with other data sources.)
So far, the data does bear out the idea that kids are not uniquely at risk of Covid-19, which is both surprising (because they usually are more vulnerable to the flu) and a relief.
But this age group obviously covers everybody from infants to kids approaching middle school. And we do have evidence that the youngest of these can see more severe cases than their older brothers and sisters in elementary school, as Vox‚Äôs Umair Irfan reported:
A study published March 16 in the journal Pediatrics of more than 2,100 children in China found that children of all ages were vulnerable to Covid-19, though the vast majority experienced mild symptoms, and some experienced none at all. A caveat for this study is that only one-third of the children in the sample were tested and confirmed to have the Covid-19 virus, SARS-CoV-2. The rest were presumptive Covid-19 cases, which means there‚Äôs a possibility that another pathogen could have caused the observed symptoms. Zeichner, who co-authored a commentary article about the findings, noted that the worst outcomes in children were often among infants. The study showed that about 30 percent of childhood Covid-19 cases deemed ‚Äúsevere‚Äù and more than half of Covid-19 cases deemed ‚Äúcritical‚Äù were among children less than 1 year old. Though the overall numbers were small ‚Äî 7 infants had critical illness and 33 suffered severe illness ‚Äî it did show that younger children faced a higher likelihood of more dangerous outcomes.
The other complication is that these younger people could still spread the disease to older generations, who are more at risk of critical illness.
Bottom line: Infants appear more vulnerable than toddlers and elementary school kids. Overall, though, only a small number of children under 10 years old are requiring hospitalization because of Covid-19 and, as of March 21, nobody in this age group has died.
Tweens and teens (10 to 19 years old)
The important stats on adolescents and just-turned-adults:
In Spain, out of 221 cases for people 10 to 19, 15 of them have been hospitalized, a 7 percent rate; none have ended up in intensive care. One person in this age range has died, a 0.4 percent fatality rate.
Italy and South Korea have reported no fatalities for this group; China reports that 0.2 percent of cases for these young people end in death.
In the US, there had been no ICU admittances or deaths reported among people under 20 as of late last week; only a small percentage (1.6 percent) had been hospitalized.
With the younger generations, same as the older generations, underlying medical conditions add to a person‚Äôs vulnerability. But the absence of health problems does not mean the absence of risk: CNN reported Sunday on a 12-year-old girl in Atlanta with Covid-19 who has no known health conditions and who is nevertheless on a ventilator.
Bottom line: Older kids and teenagers may be more resilient than their younger peers in some ways (lower hospitalization and ICU rates in Spain, the only country we have data to separate the 0-9 and 10-19 cohorts), but there is still a small risk of serious complications or death.
Young adults (20 to 29 years old)
The important stats on young adults:
In Spain, out of 1,285 cases for people 20 to 29 (a much bigger sample size than we have for children), 183 of them have been hospitalized, a 14 percent rate; eight have ended up in intensive care, a 0.6 percent rate, and four people in this age range have died, a 0.3 percent fatality rate.
Italy and South Korea have reported no fatalities for this group; China reports that 0.2 percent of cases for these young people end in death.
The CDC covers a huge 20-44 age range in its data, but here‚Äôs what we know about that entire group: 14.3 percent hospitalized, 2 percent in the ICU, and 0.1 percent fatality rate.
Bottom line: We are seeing a higher hospitalization rate among young adults compared to the teens directly behind them in age, and comparatively more of them wind up in the ICU. Fatality rates are still low, but deaths do happen. The trends that will carry through the rest of this article ‚Äî the older you get, the higher the risk ‚Äî are starting to show up.
Adults up to middle age (30 to 49 years old)
The important stats on this working-age population:
In Spain, out of 5,127 cases from this cohort, 1,028 people have been hospitalized, a 20 percent rate; 55 went to the ICU, a 1.1 percent rate; and 12 people ages 30 to 49 have died, a 0.2 percent fatality rate.
Italy (0.3 percent death rate), China (0.2 percent), and South Korea (0.1 percent) have reported deaths in this age range.
As mentioned above, the CDC covers one huge 20-44 age range in its report, but here‚Äôs what we know about that group: 14.3 percent hospitalized, 2 percent in the ICU, and 0.1 percent fatality rate.
For people 45 to 54, the CDC reports 21.2 percent have been hospitalized, 5.4 percent were put in the ICU, and 0.5 percent have died.
To prevent these numbers from becoming too abstract, the story of Jeffrey Ghazarian is a sad warning for this population. Ghazarian, a 34-year-old who lived near Los Angeles, died Thursday from Covid-19 after five days on a ventilator. He was a cancer survivor, which fits with what we know about the disease: People with past health problems and compromised immune systems are more at risk.
Bottom line: For this demographic, a significant number of people are being hospitalized, upward of one in five cases. And those final numbers from the CDC are a good example of how risk can vary within these age groups: Odds of hospitalization, intensive care, and death seem to increase from one‚Äôs early 40s to late 40s. We‚Äôve seen the same trend in Spain: The rates of hospitalization jumped from 17 percent for ages 30 to 39 to 23 percent for ages 40 to 49.
People nearing retirement age (50 to 69 years old)
The important stats on the people entering their golden years:
In Spain, out of 6,045 cases from this cohort, 2,166 people have been hospitalized, a 36 percent hospitalization rate; 221 went to the ICU, a 3.7 percent rate; and 83 people ages 50 to 69 have died, a 1.4 percent fatality rate.
Taken collectively, Italy, China, and South Korea have reported fatality rates from 0.4 percent up to 3.6 percent for people in this group.
For people 45 to 54, the CDC reports 21.2 percent have been hospitalized, 5.4 percent were put in the ICU, and 0.5 percent have died. For people 55 to 64, 20.5 percent have been hospitalized, 4.7 percent ended up in the ICU, and 1.4 percent died. For the oldest folks in this group, ages 65 to 74, hospitalizations (28.6 percent), ICU stays (8.1 percent) and deaths (2.7 percent) continue to trend upward.
For folks over 50, the risks steadily grow, both due to their age and because they are more likely to have a preexisting medical condition that exacerbates their risk. Almost half of Americans ages 55 to 64 have at least one preexisting condition, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation.
That‚Äôs a problem when an unknown pathogen strikes. More from Vox‚Äôs Brian Resnick:
The longer we live, the more likely our cells are to replicate in dangerous ways, the more damage they accumulate, and the more likely our organs are to stop functioning normally. This puts us at a heightened risk of chronic health conditions, like cancer or diabetes. Along with already weakened immune systems, these underlying diseases can make it harder for the body to ward off infections. The takeaway: It‚Äôs not just age alone that endangers people; it‚Äôs being older with one or more chronic diseases. Among the 105 patients who had died in Italy as of March 4, two-thirds had three or more preexisting conditions. The most common was hypertension, followed by ischemic heart disease and diabetes mellitus. These chronic illnesses can leave organs degraded and more vulnerable to infection. Additionally, the treatments for these conditions can suppress the immune system, leaving the body susceptible to pathogens.
Bottom line: All of these folks are in the high-risk category. A substantial minority are being hospitalized, and a handful of people out of every 100 have died. The dangers increase if they have heart or lung problems, or if they have diabetes or a cancer diagnosis.
Seniors (70 years old and older)
The important stats on older individuals:
In Spain, out of 6,152 cases from this group, 3,388 people have been hospitalized, a 55 percent hospitalization rate; 199 went to the ICU, a 3.2 percent rate; and 705 people ages 70 and older have died, a 11.4 percent fatality rate.
Italy, China, and South Korea have reported fatality rates from 6.2 percent up to 20.2 percent for people in this age range.
I‚Äôll use the 75-and-older numbers from the CDC: For ages 75 to 84, hospitalizations (30.5 percent), ICU stays (10.5 percent), and deaths (4.3 percent) are already high, and the key metrics go up even higher for people 85 and older; 31.3 percent hospitalized, 6.3 percent in the ICU, 10.4 percent fatality rate.
One note: The ICU stays could be lower for the oldest people if the disease progresses so quickly that they don‚Äôt even have an opportunity for intensive care.
Bottom line: There is no need to belabor the point, as I think one thing most people know about Covid-19 is it hurts older people the most. The data bears this out: People in this age group are the most likely to be hospitalized and to ultimately die during this pandemic.
For the rest of us, the risk is less severe but far from zero, and every person should be mindful of how their current health might make them more susceptible. And all of us, no matter our age or health status, should do our part to protect the most vulnerable through social distancing.

302,55fb1cb9-c4cd-4ac9-9e94-c3f3ec86f50a,lapido,https://emupdates.com/cv3w/,3 Weeks of Coronavirus in New York City,"NYC at this moment (April 6, 2020) seems to have crested with a wave of very sick patients, many many of them requiring intubation or other aggressive forms of oxygenation. The patients are arriving more slowly in recent days, but arrivals are often very ill. Most of us have watched many patients‚Äìnot all of them old‚Äìdeteriorate and die, sometimes very quickly, and this is psychologically traumatic. I find it particularly demoralizing to manage so many patients who are succumbing to a disease that is so poorly understood, and where all our treatment strategies are currently based on anecdote and theory, which is just slightly better than being based on nothing. We desperately need experimental data to determine what works. It is very difficult to deploy a serious research effort when the clinicians are getting crushed and the research teams are on lockdown, but we need to do better. We don‚Äôt have time for the usual publication-focused machinery of research to churn out papers in 6 months, we need trials now, every covid patient should be enrolled in a trial so we can learn something about how to treat this awful disease.
So all of what follows is based on opinion and consensus, some observational data, because experimental data does not yet exist. It would therefore not surprise me if much of it is ultimately demonstrated to be entirely wrong.
Assessment of Well Patients
Early on, there was an emphasis on COVID testing, ancillary testing (e.g. CXR, CT, labs), and discharge guidelines often based on oxygen saturation. As the epidemic has evolved, COVID testing has disappeared and the rest has become less useful. Currently, I think most of us have adopted a strategy where patients who present with COVID symptoms, but are able to walk around without oxygen, are assumed to have COVID and discharged with isolation precautions and indications for return. It is expected that some of them will return requiring admission. My main concern is not that we‚Äôre inappropriately discharging COVID patients who bounce back‚Äìit‚Äôs essential to keep people out of the hospital right now until they absolutely need admission‚Äìrather that we‚Äôre attributing every symptom to COVID and not adequately working up other causes of the patient‚Äôs symptoms. That said, it is astounding how many patients have classic COVID symptoms, it really does seem that everyone in the city has this disease. The positive test numbers you hear reported in the media are useless, we‚Äôre not testing anyone. Focus on admissions and deaths to get some sense of disease prevalence in a region.
If we had access to reliable and rapid coronavirus testing, we could have done much more, from a public health perspective, than discharge these patients with instructions to isolate, which is impossible for many folks to do in their homes. I hope such testing will become available in regions that aren‚Äôt already saturated with coronavirus, before they become saturated with coronavirus.
The ‚Äòintubate early‚Äô paradigm, where patients who ‚Äúfail‚Äù low flow oxygen (e.g. 6 L/min nasal cannula) are intubated and mechanically ventilated, has been abandoned by most centers, because intubated patients with COVID lung disease are doing very poorly, and while this may be the disease and not the mechanical ventilation, most of us believe that intubation is to be avoided until unequivocally required. Also, a low threshold to intubate further strains already-strained hospital resources.
What should be the trigger for intubation is a very difficult question right now, but saturation should not be used in isolation. Reasonable markers are respiratory distress (not simply tachypnea), altered mentation, and rising CO2. In general, when not sure, wait, augment noninvasive therapies, and reassess. This is the converse of the usual EM paradigm, which is when you‚Äôre not sure whether or not to intubate, intubate.
Here is the guidance we have come up with based on Gattinoni‚Äôs two-phase theory of disease. Many are reporting much better results using APRV instead of conventional modes of ventilation.
Noninvasive oxygenation therapies
Proning. This should be done for all patients with COVID lung disease sick enough to be admitted to the hospital, regardless of oxygenation therapy. A ‚Äúproning‚Äù team (e.g. providers otherwise idled by societal lockdown) can round on all the patients to prone them, or turn them on one side or another, which seems to improve oxygenation for many patients. Encouragement of deep breathing. Many COVID patients take very rapid but very shallow breaths. We have also noticed that many COVID patients have painful breathing, and some present with a complaint of pain instead of dyspnea. Incentive spirometry, with or without treatment with opioids, may be of benefit. High flow nasal cannula. Consensus seems to be to start with high FiO2 and low flow rate, increase flow rate as needed. Cover with surgical mask to reduce aerosolization. Noninvasive ventilation. Again it is the high concentration of oxygen that seems to be of value here rather than the pressure, so some have advocated for CPAP with a low pressure, FiO2 100% as an initial approach. Use viral filter at the level of the mask to reduce aerosolization.
To the extent that you can isolate or cohort patients on HFNC/NIV, do so. As the epidemic worsens, your ability to do this diminishes.
Pulmonary hypertension seems to play an important role in very ill COVID patients and there is some enthusiasm for using pulmonary vasodilators like inhaled nitric oxide or prostacyclin.
Anticoagulation
Prothrombosis is one of the many not-yet-understood but repeatedly observed aspects of this disease. Many institutions are moving to aggressive anticoagulation practices in COVID patients, based on trending d-dimers. At a minimum, everyone admitted should probably be prophylaxed. I‚Äôve heard two reports of COVID patients doing very poorly, not stable for CT, treated with lysis, to immediate improvement. Was it PE? Was it diffuse microthrombosis? Was it something else? Was it coincidence? We have no idea.
Cardiac Arrest
All sorts of chitchat on who should be resuscitated and how. If a patient is already intubated and receiving maximal therapies for COVID, and deteriorates and arrests, it does not seem appropriate to pursue further resuscitation, assuming no immediately reversible cause (e.g. ventilator disconnection/obstruction) is found. Undifferentiated patients arriving to the ED in cardiac arrest should, in my opinion, be managed like a patient arriving in cardiac arrest in normal times, with one exception: the patient should be assumed to have COVID, and appropriate measures should be taken to protect staff and other patients from aerosols generated during intubation and chest compressions. See this impossibly well-produced video.
Ventilator Allocation
Despite the media clickbait frenzy on this topic, to my knowledge there has been no need for any hospital to go on an allocation protocol, but that time may come. You do not want that time to come without a protocol that you have established and vetted. Here is one protocol.
Emergency Department and Hospital Flow
At first, departments try to separate into hot and cold zones, but as the prevalence of COVID increases in the community, most of us have noticed that everyone presenting for any reason has evidence of COVID (e.g. the man who was in the midst of a 40 mile bicycle ride gets hit by a car, breaks his leg, has no other symptoms, but CT shows lungs full of COVID, all of us have seen this repeatedly). So, at least in NYC, the entire ED becomes a COVID zone.
I have nothing to add to the national referendum on PPE other than to say that wearing PPE for the duration of an ED shift is difficult, and I think every ED worker in the city is now wearing a single full PPE getup for their entire shift, regardless of where they are in the department. Think about where providers are going to don/doff PPE, where providers are going to store PPE if it has to be reused. Where in the department/hospital/offices PPE will be allowed, and not allowed. For example, is PPE allowed in the breakroom? What will you do with the food that is donated by the community, that your providers will really want to eat? Seems like a trivial problem but it isn‚Äôt, frontline gotta eat. Useful to designate a (nonclinical, probably) person to manage food and PPE donations.
Non-COVID ED visits have dropped off precipitously, no one has any idea where all the strokes, heart attacks, intoxicated and withdrawing patients are. However the fraction of patients requiring admission has skyrocketed; the majority of people who arrive to the ED now require significant oxygen support and admission.
Many if not most of these patients are on advanced oxygen therapies (HFNC, NIV, or MV) but most hospitals do not have even close to the personnel or structural resources required to optimally care for this volume of ICU/Stepdown patients. This is perhaps the greatest struggle in the latest stage of the epidemic in NYC: providing intensive care to 10x the number of patients the hospital is set up for. Many ED‚Äôs at the moment are functioning as huge ICUs, caring for enormous numbers of critically ill patients awaiting inpatient beds. It‚Äôs even worse upstairs, because standard medical wards are now also ICUs/Stepdowns filled with patients who have very high oxygen requirements, but unlike the ED, these patients are behind closed doors and wards are not resourced to provide the level of monitoring required, and if someone knocks off their NIV mask or HFNC, they can run into trouble very quickly. The number of ‚ÄúAnesthesia, STAT‚Äù calls to ward beds is a jarring reflection of the grim conditions. Plan to augment ward staff (physicians, nurses, technicians, anyone) to keep more eyes on these patients.
Because the arrivals volume is so low, very few ED staff are needed to do emergency medicine, and many of us are repurposed to provide ICU/Stepdown inpatient care to the admitted patients. It would be wise to plan for this transition, because it‚Äôs very disorienting, especially when you‚Äôre trying to do it in a Tyvek suit for 10 hours. Many units are attempting to leverage other services that are inactive during societal lockdown, and there is a role for just about everyone: The patients, if nothing else (and there is a lot else) need food, water, hygiene, their home meds, an update on their condition (if they‚Äôre conscious), someone to talk to their families who are not allowed inside. Any healthcare provider can do this. In one NYC hospital, the surgical service has taken over an entire wing of the ED filled with ICU/Stepdown patients and is just running it, caring for these patients as though they‚Äôre in the SICU, because they might as well be. It is an awesome demonstration of our shared purpose and the petty illogic of our usual balkanized culture. People are ready to step up. Utilize them.",[],2020-04-06 14:54:49

Are people with asthma more likely to experience severe complications and require ventilation?
So far, we do not have any evidence that asthma patients are having severe complications with COVID-19. In the UK, the first report of intensive care unit admitted patients was released in mid-March and of 196 patients, only three had severe underlying lung conditions. This is lower than we would expect and suggests that most of the people being admitted with severe complications are not currently patients with lung conditions.
Are people with asthma who have had COVID-19 recovering?
Yes. So far there have been very few cases of severe COVID-19 infections in people with asthma and those that have been infected are recovering.
I have asthma and use my preventer inhaler. I know this has steroids and I‚Äôve been told that this can make COVID-19 symptoms worse. What should I do?
What you have been told is wrong. Patients with asthma should never stop taking their preventer inhaler unless asked to do so by a medical professional. Stopping your steroid inhaler could put you at higher risk of complications with COVID-19 due to making your asthma worse. There is currently no reason to think that steroids make COVID-19 worse and research from China suggests steroids may make COVID-19 less severe. A UK trial is currently testing whether steroids work as a treatment here.
Are patients who are using anti-IL5 treatments or similar, that reduce eosinophils, at higher risk? Should they stop or modify dosages?
Do not stop or modify any of your asthma medications because of concern about COVID-19. There is a risk that doing that could make your asthma control worse, causing you to need medical treatment or hospital admission.
Anti-IL-5 should have no effect on the risk of getting COVID-19, and keeping taking it could theoretically reduce the risk of an asthma attack if you were to contract the virus.
I work in healthcare and have to wear a facemask; I started experiencing asthma symptoms. Is there evidence that masks may trigger asthma symptoms?
There is no specific evidence that masks make asthma worse, but triggers for asthma symptoms are not always obvious and not always identified. If you think that something at work is making your asthma worse it may be appropriate to talk to your doctor or to the occupational health department for advice.
Bronchiectasis:
Is there anything specific I should know about COVID-19 and my condition?
People with bronchiectasis might be at higher risk of complications if they get the COVID-19, so here are a few suggestions to reduce your risk of getting the infection and the risk of complications if you do:
Avoid contact with anyone who is sick. Ask sick friends or relatives not to visit you and keep distance of at least 2 metres from anyone sick that you encounter in public.
Do not touch your mouth, nose or eyes with unwashed hands unless unavoidable.
Wash your hands thoroughly after touching surfaces that may be contaminated. Wash your hands with warm water and soap for 20 seconds.
Make sure you take all of your regular medications and keep up with your usual treatments to keep your lungs as healthy as possible.
Specifically for bronchiectasis, ensure you do your airway clearance exercises regularly- this clears mucus from the lungs and reduces the risk of a flare-up (exacerbation).
If you develop a fever and cough, but feel well, try to increase the frequency of your airway clearance and take paracetamol to reduce fever. If you become more unwell, seek medical advice. If you have a home supply of antibiotics, as many patients with bronchiectasis do, only take this if your sputum (phlegm) increases in amount or becomes discoloured. Antibiotics will not work against a virus, but would treat a bacterial infection.
I have bronchiectasis. Should I be self-isolating? And I am I more at risk of severe illness?
Bronchiectasis is a very diverse condition from severe to mild, and so it is not possible to give one recommendation that covers everyone.
People with bronchiectasis, if it is severe, meaning that you have frequent chest infections and/or take a long-term preventative antibiotics, should practice ‚Äúshielding‚Äù, meaning staying indoors for the next 12 weeks.
Patients with mild bronchiectasis, where you have only a mild cough and do not suffer from frequent chest infections might be ok to socially distance, meaning that you stay at home as much as possible but can still go outside for essential shopping or exercise.
We do not know if bronchiectasis patients are more likely to have complications but I would recommend playing it safe.
Are people with bronchiectasis getting over COVID-19?
I am currently only aware of one patient with bronchiectasis who has had confirmed COVID-19 and they have recovered well, but none of the published studies has so far included people with bronchiectasis.
Cancer:
I have had cancer and was treated with chemotherapy and radiation; this was some time ago but am I still at a higher risk of COVID-19?
It is difficult to comment on a specific case. The vast majority of people, even if they acquired COVID-19 and even if they have underlying conditions will have a mild illness similar to a cold or the flu. Severe heart disease and lung disease have been associated with worse outcomes, particularly in patients that are over the age of 80 years. Cancer, when successfully treated, is not usually a risk factor for worse outcomes in respiratory infections like COVID-19.
Find more information about cancer and COVID-19 at www.womenagainstlungcancer.eu/emergenza-covid-19/#more
Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD):
I have COPD, how will COVID-19 affect me?
We have learned that in about 50% of people who contract COVID-19, they experience no symptoms at all. Some people will experience a mild cold with running nose, sore muscles, fever and a cough. Others develop a more ‚Äúflu-like‚Äù illness with worse fever, sore muscles and tiredness. In the most severe cases it causes a pneumonia with breathlessness and coughing in addition to the symptoms above.
Because COPD patients have lung problems to begin with, they may be more likely to experience breathlessness with COVID-19, and more likely therefore to need hospital treatment. Nevertheless, most people with COPD would experience no symptoms or just mild symptoms and make a full recovery.
What are the risks of COVID-19 for people with severe pulmonary emphysema?
Patients with severe COPD and emphysema are among those considered to be at higher risk of complications from COVID-19. This is because the lungs are affected by COVID-19, and if the lungs are already slightly damaged, they have less ability to fight the virus.
Cystic fibrosis:
Is there anything that I should not do as someone with cystic fibrosis?
Please follow guidance from your healthcare professionals and the local response to COVID-19.
We do not recommend self-isolation for all people with CF, but it may be appropriate to stay at home as much as possible.
Avoid places where there is likely to be an increased risk of exposure such as crowds - especially in poorly ventilated areas.
Currently there are no blanket recommendations about school attendance. This will depend on your local circumstances and individual advice from your local CF centre.
If you are employed, we recommend contacting your employer to consider what reasonable adjustments can be made to your working conditions to help protect you. Your local CF centre may be able to provide advice and support for this.
The information above was summarised from the Cystic fibrosis Trust. They are found here https://www.cysticfibrosis.org.uk/news/COVID-19-qa
UK CF Medical Association advise
Lung transplant:
I‚Äôve had a lung transplant. Is there any specific advice that applies to me?
Your transplant team or specialist may already have a plan in place and if so you should follow their advice.
In general, if you develop symptoms that would be consistent with a viral infection it would be advisable to self-isolate at home and contact your local transplant team for advice. If you are unwell with problems such as difficult breathing you should seek medical attention urgently, as would be the case at any other time.
Pneumonia:
I am generally healthy, but have had pneumonia several times. Does this mean that I will be affected more severely?
No, previous infections do not increase the risk of more severe infections in future unless the previous infections were due to other diseases (such as severe heart or lung conditions, diabetes or conditions or drugs that suppress the immune system).
Tuberculosis:
I have TB; treatment is going well, but should I self-isolate?
You should follow the national guidelines in your country. In the UK this would mean social distancing, which is not the same as self-isolating. You should stay at home as much as possible, but you can go out once a day for shopping and/or exercise. You should stay away from anyone else who is not in your family (maintain a distance of at least 2 metres while you are out).
What about patients with TB on anti-TB treatment if they get infected with COVID-19? Is there any guidance of recommendation for treatment?
It is important to continue with your TB treatment even if you start to feel unwell. Keep taking your medications unless advised by a healthcare professional. TB should not have any effect on the severity of COVID-19 infection. Treatment of COVID-19 infection might be more complicated due to interaction between TB medications and other medications, so it is important you speak to a pharmacist or doctor before taking medication.
I had TB, I was treated and recovered, but have lasting damage to one of my lungs. Does this put me at a greater risk if I get COVID-19?
Possibly. Post-TB lung damage often puts you at a higher risk of picking up chest infections and so you might be at slightly higher risk of having a chest infection if you were infected with COVID-19. It is important to emphasise, however, that most people experience either a mild illness or no symptoms at all, even if you have underlying lung disease.
Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency
Do you recommend to patients receiving augmentation/replacement therapy for Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency that they should continue attending hospital to receive their treatment or is it better to go without for some weeks/months until the risk of infection diminishes?
You would have to discuss this with your doctor who will know whether your treatment is essential or could be delayed until infection rates start to decline where you are.
Collapsed lung (pneumothorax)
I have had pneumothorax; does this make me more at risk if I catch COVID-19? Am I more likely to get pneumonia?
Not unless you also have other underlying health conditions. Pneumothorax can occur in a completely healthy person, and in that case, you are not at any greater risk from coronavirus than anyone else. If your pneumothorax was a complication of COPD, cystic fibrosis or another lung condition, then it is the underlying lung condition that would put you at risk.
I have had pneumothorax; is my lung likely to collapse again if I get COVID-19?
There is no evidence that this is the case. Pneumothorax is a rare complication of viral infections and there is no evidence that previous pneumothorax would put you more at risk unless you have another underlying lung condition.
(Idiopathic) pulmonary fibrosis
I have (idiopathic) pulmonary fibrosis, am I more at risk if I get COVID-19?
Yes, the expert groups on idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis have said that the disease increases the risk of complications when patients develop COVID-19. Therefore, patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis should make every effort to avoid infection. In some European countries, patients with IPF have been advised to ‚Äúshield‚Äù, meaning not to leave the house for 12 weeks except in exceptional circumstances. Even though the risk is increased in patients with IPF, most IPF patients that develop COVID-19 will still have a mild infection and recover fully.
Other:
I currently have flu, should I be more worried?
If you have a confirmed influenza (flu) infection, then no, you don‚Äôt need to be more worried. Getting one virus does not make you more likely to get another infection.
I have pleural thickening, does this put me at a higher risk if I catch COVID-19?
No, pleural thickening would not affect the risk of catching COVID-19 and would not increase the risk of complications unless it is combined with other heart or lung conditions.
I have pleurisy, am I more vulnerable if I contact COVID-19?
No, unless the pleurisy is due to another underlying lung condition. The lung conditions that place you at greater risk are those that affect the airways or cause lower lung function, such as COPD, severe asthma, bronchiectasis, cystic fibrosis, pulmonary fibrosis or lung cancer.
I have had part of my lung removed ‚Äì how will COVID-19 affect me?
If you are otherwise healthy, there is no reason to think that this would make COVID-19 infection more severe or more likely.
This information also applies to healthy people with smaller lungs caused for example, by scoliosis or kyphosis. It might cause some restriction of your lung volume and your risk would depend on how severe the restriction was, but in general you would not be at significantly increased risk of complications.
I have a pulmonary embolism, how will COVID-19 affect me?
Pulmonary embolism, if it has been treated with blood thinning medication and your oxygen levels are normal, would not be expected to have any effect on your risk of complications with COVID-19.
I am over 70 and have been diagnosed with Chronic Thromboembolic Disease and I am on lifelong Warfarin. What are the risks and should I remain in doors for 12 weeks?
The recommendations are different in different countries, but in the UK at the moment (for example) you would not be asked to remain indoors for 12 weeks. You would be asked to ‚ÄúSocially distance‚Äù, meaning:
Avoid contact with someone who is displaying symptoms of coronavirus (COVID-19). These symptoms include high temperature and/or new and continuous cough
Avoid non-essential use of public transport when possible
Work from home, where possible.
Avoid large and small gatherings in public spaces, noting that pubs, restaurants, leisure centres and similar venues are currently shut as infections spread easily in closed spaces where people gather together.
Avoid gatherings with friends and family. Keep in touch using remote technology such as phone, internet, and social media
Use telephone or online services to contact your GP or other essential services
Only those with severe underlying conditions such as immune problems, cancer or severe COPD, asthma and other lung conditions are being asked to stay indoors for 12 weeks. Chronic thromboembolic disease in not one of these conditions.
I have a chronic cough; am I at a higher risk if I catch COVID-19?
No, if you have a chronic cough that is not due to a severe lung condition like COPD or cystic fibrosis, you would not be considered to be at higher risk.
I have had VATS and pleurodesis, does this put me at a higher risk of severe illness?
No, VATS and pleurodesis treat the pleura - the lining of the lung. There is no evidence that COVID-19 affects the lining of the lung and so there is no reason to think this would make you more likely to get severe illness.
I have low IgM levels, what risks does this pose to myself and my family at this time?
Low levels of IgM, if they are not associated with low levels of IgG or IgA or another medical condition, would not be expected to greatly increase your risk of severe COVID-19 infection.
My mother was diagnosed with oesophageal palsy how might COVID-19 affect her? Is she at high risk?
It is hard to comment on individual cases, but this does not sound like a risk factor, in and of itself, for complications of COVID-19.
Is a punctured lung a high-risk condition?
No, not if the punctured lung has repaired itself , or has been repaired through treatment with a chest drain. You would not be at any higher risk of complications than the general population if your lungs are otherwise healthy.
I have primary ciliary dyskinesia syndrome (PCD), am I more at risk if I catch COVID-19?
Yes, we think that because primary ciliary dyskinesia makes it harder to clear the lungs, it could make COVID-19 more severe. For that reason, in many countries patients with PCD have been advised to stay in the house and pay extra special attention to hand hygiene, social distancing and avoiding visitors to the house.
I have more than 50% tracheal stenosis, am I more at risk if I catch COVID-19?
It is very difficult to comment on individual cases. You may be more at risk if this causes you to have frequent chest infections or to have lower lung function that normal. It is important to remember that even if you have a slighter higher risk, most people that catch COVID-19 recovery fully.
I have had whooping cough (pertussis), am I more at risk if I catch COVID-19?
No, not unless you have been left with permanent lung damage , such as bronchiectasis, as a result.
I have cysts in my lungs, am I more at risk if I catch COVID-19?
Probably not, unless the cysts in the lungs have caused a lower lung function or lower oxygen level than normal.
I have benign metastasizing leiomyomatosis, am I more at risk if I catch COVID-19?
This is quite a rare condition and so there will not be specific information about this condition and COVID-19. In general, we think that people are more at risk if they have very low lung function tests, get breathless easily (such as having to stop after walking 100 metres or less) or have frequent chest infections. If your condition is not causing these kinds of symptoms and signs, you are not likely to be at greatly increased risk.
I‚Äôve had aspergillosis; am I at greater risk if I get COVID-19?
It depends on whether your aspergillosis is still active or not. If it has been successfully treated and you are feeling well you should be at no further risk. If you are very breathless, such as not being able to walk 100m without stopping, or have low lung function due to your aspergillosis, you would be at higher risk of complications. If this is the case, you should pay special attention to social distancing measures and may be advised to stay at home as much as possible.
I have left pulmonary agenesis; am I at greater risk if I get COVID-19?
It is difficult to comment without more information but it is quite likely. People with severe lung conditions are at higher risk such as patients that have low lung function and those who get breathless walking short distances such as 100m. You should discuss with your doctor whether you should be taking extra measures to protect yourself such as ‚Äúshielding‚Äù.
Does a high IgE level increase my risk of COVID-19?
No, a high IgE level by itself would not increase your risk of COVID or complications if you get COVID-19. There is no evidence that IgE is involved in COVID-19.",[],2020-04-30 00:00:00

VERDICT Cough was observed in less than half of the mild cases in the largest included study and in two thirds of cases in a systematic review, suggesting it is unreliable as a key diagnostic symptom.
Fever (< 39.1 ¬∞C) was the most frequent symptom for mild and moderate cases of COVID-19, though a recent UK study suggests anosmia may be a stronger predictor of COVID-19 than self-reported fever amongst people in the community.
Overall, we found scarce and inconclusive evidence on symptoms that easily distinguish mild and moderate cases of COVID-19 from severe cases.
The majority of available evidence was from hospitalised patients. Mild and moderate cases were usually defined as those without pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission. Applicability to community cohorts is therefore uncertain.
Other reported symptoms include dyspnea, headache, diarrhoea, sore throat, fatigue and rhinorrhea.
BACKGROUND
COVID-19 presents varied clinical features, ranging from asymptomatic to ARDS. The most common symptoms at onset of COVID-19 include fever, cough, and shortness of breath.1 Yet about 80% of infections are mild (no pneumonia manifestations) or asymptomatic, though still contagious.2 If the virus is not causing serious symptoms, people are less likely to recognise it, take protective measures, or seek medical help, thus affecting the public health efforts to contain the disease. As the virus continues to spread, more mild cases will arise and healthcare professionals need to recognise these to minimise the population, health systems, and economic risks and accurately portray total numbers of COVID-19 infections. Differentiating mild and moderate from severe disease may also help clinicians in more accurately triaging cases.
CURRENT EVIDENCE
Our search (see below) produced 53 results, 10 were duplicate and 31 were eliminated based on not addressing the question. An additional 6 were included through the google search, for a total of 18 studies.
Summary of the body of evidence
Description Volume 18 studies were included Quality 1 was a systematic review and meta-analysis, 11 were retrospective cohort studies and 6 were case studies Applicability 11 studies were in China, 2 in Germany, 1 in the US, 1 In Singapore, 1 in Korea and 1 in the UK. Participants were of varying ages and background. Consistency Findings varied between studies, mainly due to the fact that case definition of mild/moderate or severe disease varied and sample sizes were small. Results should be generalised with caution.
Critical appraisal checklist
The CASP checklist3 was used for cohort studies and the JBI Critical Appraisal Checklist4 for Case Report. The most common limitations were a failure to justify sample size and lack of sufficient evaluation timeframe. Most studies had limited population size and demographics and short evaluation period, limiting the certainty around the final results.
EMERGING EVIDENCE IN COVID-19
Severity definition
All but one included study recruited patients from hospital settings only. Mild or moderate cases were generally defined based on less severe clinical symptoms (low grade fever, cough, discomfort) with no evidence of pneumonia. 6,10 and not requiring admission to ICU. However, some studies included people with pneumonia or respiratory tract infections as mild cases 13,14, as long as they did not develop ARDS, organ failure or have an ICU admission.7 9-11 One study did report results for asymptomatic patients, but it is not clear why these people were hospitalised.5 The single systematic review21 carried forward cases defined as ‚Äòsevere‚Äô from the original studies without comparing these definitions of severity. The exception was a study from the UK, which collected information from the general public in relation to COVID-19 via a symptom tracker app, called COVID RADAR.22
Key findings
The single systematic review found no statistically significant difference in common symptoms between people with severe or mild / moderate COVID-19 infection. 21
The key symptoms reported in the cohort studies included:
Fever is the most common symptom among mild to moderate cases. 5-14 According to the two largest studies, fever was reported in 82 ‚Äì 87% of these cases. 5,9 Studies reported mild patients had low to moderate fever (< 39.1 ¬∞C). 5-7,12,13,16- 20
is the most common symptom among mild to moderate cases. According to the two largest studies, fever was reported in 82 ‚Äì 87% of these cases. Studies reported mild patients had low to moderate fever (< 39.1 ¬∞C). Cough was the second most common symptom observed in all studies. 5-14 It was observed in 44% and 36.5% of cases in the largest studies, but in 65.7 (95% CI 57.8-73.5) of patients with non-severe disease in the systematic review. 5,9 ‚Äì
was the second most common symptom observed in all studies. It was observed in 44% and 36.5% of cases in the largest studies, but in 65.7 (95% CI 57.8-73.5) of patients with non-severe disease in the systematic review. The COVID RADAR survey found that amongst individuals with sufficient symptoms to have a RT-PCR test, prevalence of anosmia was 3-fold higher (59.4%) in those testing positive than those testing negative (19.0%). Loss of smell may therefore be a strong predictor of COVID-19 infection. Anosmia in combination with fever, fatigue, persistent cough, diarrhoea, abdominal pain and loss of appetite predicted COVID-19 infection with a specificity of 0.83 (95%CI 0.81-0.86) and sensitivity of 0.55 (95%CI 0.50-0.59). 22 The model performed equally well across different age and sex groups.

The model performed equally well across different age and sex groups. Across studies dyspnea was more frequent in severe cases and indeed, in some studies, was a marker of severe disease. 5-9, 14 In the systematic review and meta-analysis 21 , dyspnea was present in 44.2% (95% CI 7.8-80.6) of people with severe and 5.7% (0-10.7%) of people with non-severe infection. The two largest studies 5,9 report 1.4% of mild cases (compared to 32.6% of severe cases) and 7.6% of mild cases experienced dyspnea, respectively. Normal breathing rates more common in mild cases. 13,14

The two largest studies report 1.4% of mild cases (compared to 32.6% of severe cases) and 7.6% of mild cases experienced dyspnea, respectively. Normal breathing rates more common in mild cases. Other symptoms reported include headache, 5-9,13 rhinorrhea, 7-9,14 gastrointestinal symptoms, 7-9, 13, 14 sore throat,6-9, 14 and fatigue. 5,9,12,13 Rhinorrhea was present in below 10% of the mild cases. 7-9,14 Chest pain and tightness were not frequent, with less than 5% of mild cases experiencing pain7,8 and 10.7% tightness.7 Expectoration in mild cases varied between 2%6 and 56%.13 Gastrointestinal reaction, while reported in 5 studies, was below 10% in all each7-9,13 except for Young et al14 who reports 25% of mild cases compared to none in severe cases.
Six case studies and series reported variability in COVID-19 symptoms, ranging from asymptomatic to minor upper respiratory tract infections, fever, or mild gastrointestinal reaction. Disease course also varied with some cases reported to have rapid symptom cessation or late onset.
Lim et al 15 reported a patient with normal vital signs but a CT scan that showed a small consolidation in the right upper lobe and ground-glass opacities in both lower lobes.

Arashiro et al 17 reported on the variation in time to symptom resolution in mild disease. One case had persistent, minor upper respiratory tract symptoms but continued to test positive for COVID-19 for 23 days, whereas another case with a slight fever of 38.6¬∞C, sore throat, and cough, had rapid symptom cessation but persistent viral RNA detection for over 2 weeks.

Ji et al16 emphasized the variability of symptoms in children with 2 pediatric mild cases with different clinical manifestations (upper respiratory tract infection compared to mild diarrhoea) and thus the importance of being vigilant in family clusters.
Limitations
Evidence is still scarce.
Most studies had short observation periods, small sample sizes and were conducted in a single geographical region, meaning results cannot be immediately generalized.
Some studies were not only on mild cases but were included because they were mainly on mild cases (see Wu et al).
The majority of studies were conducted in hospital settings.
CONCLUSIONS
Scarce and inconclusive evidence on symptoms that easily distinguish mild and moderate cases. Additional evidence is needed with longer observation periods and larger population size and a more diverse demographic.
Fever (< 39.1 ¬∞C) and cough are the most frequent symptoms even in mild disease, but relying on cough to diagnose COVID-19 may be misleading as it was observed in less than half of the mild cases in the largest studies of this review.
One study reports anosmia is a strong predictor of COVID-19 infection.
Presenting symptoms varied widely but, in combination, anosmia, fever, fatigue, persistent cough, diarrhoea, abdominal pain and loss of appetite have a reasonable specificity for COVID-19 diagnosis, though average sensitivity.
Symptoms can have rapid cessation or late onset and some people will also be asymptomatic.

For months, Singapore‚Äôs leaders urged citizens to wear masks only when ill, especially after locals panicked and rushed to stores to grab bundles of the essentials as the coronavirus spread. Now, they‚Äôve shifted tack.
In a live address to the nation Friday afternoon, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said his government will stop discouraging the general public from wearing face masks in public.
That came as the city-state moved to close schools and most workplaces to contain the virus. Reusable masks will be distributed from April 5, Lee said.
‚ÄúWearing a mask may help to protect others, in case you have the virus but don‚Äôt know it,‚Äù Lee said, noting the World Health Organization and the U.S.‚Äôs Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are also reviewing advisories.
The global thinking on wearing masks has begun to shift over the past week. Many countries initially urged citizens not to wear them unless they were symptomatic or looking after those who were ill. Some authorities even claimed that untrained civilians wearing masks could cause a rise in cases.
No Symptoms
But some of the countries with the strictest policies on wearing masks are also reporting lowest number of cases per capita. In China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, South Korea and Japan mask-wearing has become the norm, with some stores refusing entry to those without face covers. A Singaporean study also found cases where patients had spread the virus despite showing no symptoms.
Now even nations that had been steadfast in their opposition to usage by the masses, such as the U.S., have changed their tune as the number of infections linked to local sources with no history of international travel continues to grow. Sources familiar with the White House‚Äôs thinking told Bloomberg that it was likely to urge face covers to combat the virus.
The changing advice is likely to add further pressure on mask-making companies such as 3M Co., which have already ramped up production in an effort to meet skyrocketing demand from hospitals and governments.
Elaborating on Singapore‚Äôs shift, National Development Minister Lawrence Wong said at a press conference after Lee‚Äôs address that the original position was based on scientific evidence. That was also the WHO‚Äôs advice, he added.
‚ÄòDifferent Situation‚Äô
‚ÄúBut we now are in a different situation because we‚Äôre seeing new data, new information being put out, including evidence that infected persons with no symptoms may infect others,‚Äù said Wong, who also co-chairs a ministerial task force to tackle the virus.
Aside from new scientific evidence, another reason for changing tack was because Singapore‚Äôs now in a different situation. It‚Äôs seeing a rise in locally transmitted cases and unlinked cases. On average, Singapore‚Äôs seeing 25 locally transmitted cases a day, Health Minister Gan Kim Yong said.
The city-state is trying its best to replenish its supplies, Wong said. Surgical masks will be conserved for health care workers as they need them most.
For the rest of the population, some form of masks, even reusable ones can serve as a barrier and provide some basic protection, Wong said.
‚ÄúBefore we didn‚Äôt have community spread of the virus, now we‚Äôre seeing an increase in locally transmitted cases and we are also concerned about possibly undetected carriers within our community,‚Äù Wong said. ‚ÄúAnd so, because of all of these reasons, we‚Äôve decided the position on masks has to be updated.‚Äù","['Faris Mokhtar', 'David Ramli']",2020-04-03 11:48:03

South Korean officials announced 111 such cases as of April 12.
Because SARS-CoV-2, the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19, was only discovered a few months ago, scientists are still trying to answer many big questions related to the virus and the disease it causes.
The World Health Organization (WHO) is investigating the reports of patients testing positive after being released from treatment, but said it has no findings yet. ‚ÄúWe are closely liaising with our clinical experts and working hard to get more information on those individual cases,‚Äù the agency told Reuters April 11.
With other coronavirus strains, experts say the antibodies that patients produce during infection give them immunity to the specific virus for months or even years, but researchers are still figuring out if and how that works with COVID-19.
The answer has huge implications for the spread of the disease, since researchers believe it will continue to crash across the world in waves, hitting the same country multiple times.
Can you get re-infected after recovering from COVID-19?
There remains a lot of uncertainty, but experts TIME spoke with say that it‚Äôs likely the reports of patients who seemed to have recovered but then tested positive again were not examples of re-infection, but were cases where lingering infection was not detected by tests for a period of time.
Experts say the body‚Äôs antibody response, triggered by the onset of a virus, means it is unlikely that patients who have recovered from COVID-19 can get re-infected so soon after contracting the virus. Antibodies are normally produced in a patient‚Äôs body around seven to 10 days after the initial onset of a virus, says Vineet Menachery, a virologist at the University of Texas Medical Branch.
Instead, testing positive after recovery could just mean the tests resulted in a false negative and that the patient is still infected. ‚ÄúIt may be because of the quality of the specimen that they took and may be because the test was not so sensitive,‚Äù explains David Hui, a respiratory medicine expert at the Chinese University of Hong Kong who also studied the 2002-2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), which is caused by a coronavirus in the same family as SARS-CoV-2.
A positive test after recovery could also be detecting the residual viral RNA that has remained in the body, but not in high enough amounts to cause disease, says Menachery. ‚ÄúViral RNA can last a long time even after the actual virus has been stopped.‚Äù

Can the virus be ‚Äòreactivated‚Äô after you recover?
In announcing that recovered patients were re-testing positive, South Korea‚Äôs Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) offered a new theory: that the virus could have been ‚Äúreactivated.‚Äù
But experts are more skeptical. Oh Myoung-don, a professor of internal medicine at Seoul National University and a member of the WHO‚Äôs Strategic and Technical Advisory Group for Infectious Hazards, says the most plausible explanation is that the tests picked up lingering viral genetic material, rather than reemergent infection.
‚ÄúEven after the virus is dead, the nucleic acid (RNA) fragments still remain in the cells,‚Äù says Oh. He says reactivation of the virus is not as likely.
In South Korea, patients must test negative in two tests within 24 hours before they are released from quarantine.
What research has there been on this subject?
A study on recovered COVID-19 patients in the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen found that 38 out of 262, or almost 15% of the patients, tested positive after they were discharged. They were confirmed via PCR (polymerase chain reaction) tests, currently the gold standard for coronavirus testing. The study has yet to be peer reviewed, but offers some early insight into the potential for re-infection. The 38 patients were mostly young (below the age of 14) and displayed mild symptoms during their period of infection. The patients generally were not symptomatic at the time of their second positive test.
In Wuhan, China, where the pandemic began, researchers looked at a case study of four medical workers who had three consecutive positive PCR tests after having seemingly recovered. Similar to the study in Shenzhen, the patients were asymptomatic and their family members were not infected.
Does recovering from COVID-19 make you immune?
There hasn‚Äôt been enough time to research COVID-19 in order to determine whether patients who recover from COVID-19 are immune to the disease‚Äîand if so, how long the immunity will last. However, preliminary studies provide some clues. For example, one study conducted by Chinese researchers (which has not yet been peer-reviewed) found that antibodies in rhesus monkeys kept primates that had recovered from COVID-19 from becoming infected again upon exposure to the virus.
In the absence of more information, researchers have been looking at what is known about other members of the coronavirus family. ‚ÄúWe are only three and a half months into the pandemic,‚Äù Hsu Li Yang, an associate professor and infectious disease expert at the National University of Singapore, says. ‚ÄúThe comments we‚Äôre making are based on previous knowledge of other human coronavirus and SARS. But whether they extrapolate across COVID-19, we‚Äôre not so sure at present.‚Äù
One study conducted by Taiwanese researchers found that survivors of the SARS outbreak in 2003 had antibodies that lasted for up to three years‚Äîsuggesting immunity. Hui notes that survivors of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS, which is also caused by a virus related to the one that causes COVID-19) were found to last just around a year.
Menachery estimates that COVID-19 antibodies will remain in a patient‚Äôs system for ‚Äútwo to three years,‚Äù based on what‚Äôs known about other coronaviruses, but he says it‚Äôs too early to know for certain. The degree of immunity could also differ from person to person depending on the strength of the patient‚Äôs antibody response. Younger, healthier people will likely generate a more robust antibody response, giving them more protection against the virus in future.
‚ÄúWe would expect that if you have antibodies that neutralize the virus, you will have immunity,‚Äù Menachery says. ‚ÄúHow long the antibodies last is still in question.‚Äù

There may have been some rare cases of reinfection with Covid-19, but most people seem to be immune afterwards, at least in the short term
A few readers have asked us whether you can catch Covid-19 twice. This follows reports at the end of February that a Japanese woman had tested positive a second time. A recent article in the Daily Mail and two articles in the Sun also suggested in their headlines and their early paragraphs that this might be the case.
The evidence so far shows that catching the disease twice is very rare, and that most infected people recover and develop immunity against it. However, it is not yet clear how long this immunity will last.
When a journalist raised the case of the woman in Japan at the Prime Minister‚Äôs press conference on 16 March, the Chief Scientific Advisor, Sir Patrick Vallance said: ‚ÄúIn any infectious disease there are cases where people can catch something again. They‚Äôre rare. There‚Äôs nothing to suggest that this is a common occurrence in this disease, but we are learning as we go along.‚Äù
A report from the European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention on 25 March says, ‚Äúthere is emerging evidence from early studies suggesting that individuals develop antibodies after infection and are likely to be immune from reinfection in the short term‚Äù.
During a live question-and-answer session on 25 March, Professor Jimmy Whitworth from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine said: ‚ÄúThere have been a few isolated examples where [reinfection] has been reported. That people were positive, then they were negative, then they were positive again.
‚ÄúIt looks like, in the great majority of cases, this doesn‚Äôt happen. That people get infected once. My suspicion is that those discrepant test results that we get are to do with, actually, the sampling. It‚Äôs not straightforward to take a sample from the back of the throat and make sure you catch virus every time. So I suspect it‚Äôs a technical issue, rather than repeat infection‚Ä¶ It looks like you are immune for getting it again, but for how long, we don‚Äôt know yet.‚Äù
The articles in the Daily Mail and the Sun cite several reports from China, which describe a small number of recovered Covid-19 patients testing positive for the disease again.
As the Mail and Sun articles say, based on local reports, the patients who tested positive twice in Wuhan showed no symptoms the second time and none apparently passed the disease to others.
The same was true of a group of patients who tested positive twice in Guangdong province. The Sun quotes a doctor involved in the research saying the results were in the ‚Äúweak positive‚Äù range, suggesting that the virus may no longer have been active. He also added that there may have been problems with sampling.
The Mail quotes the director of Wuhan‚Äôs Tongji Hospital, Wang Wei, saying: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs possible that these recovered patients tested negative before because of false results... The accuracy of a nucleic acid test is 30 to 50 per cent.‚Äù
In short, these cases do not show that it is common for people to contract Covid-19 twice, as it is possible that the virus had not yet left these patients‚Äô bodies after their first infection.",['Leo Benedictus'],2020-03-31 00:00:00

Boris Johnson has said people in the UK should avoid ""non-essential"" travel and contact with others to curb coronavirus.
The prime minister said people should work from home where possible as part of a range of stringent new measures.
Pregnant women, people over the age of 70 and those with certain health conditions should consider the advice ""particularly important"", he said.
People in at-risk groups will be asked within days to stay home for 12 weeks.
Health Secretary Matt Hancock told the House of Commons ""the disease is now accelerating"".
In the first of a series of daily briefings on the virus, which causes the Covid-19 disease, Mr Johnson said ""drastic action"" was needed as the UK approaches ""the fast growth part of the upward curve"" in the number of cases.
Mr Johnson said that by next weekend, those with the most serious health conditions must be ""largely shielded from social contact for around 12 weeks"".
....
The prime minister will host Monday's press conference with UK chief medical adviser, Prof Chris Whitty, and Sir Patrick Vallance, the UK's chief scientific adviser
Boris Johnson will outline the next steps in the UK's plan to fight coronavirus at the first of a series of daily news conferences.
The briefing will follow a Cobra meeting which is expected to look at what steps the government could take to protect elderly and vulnerable people.
The over-70s have been told they are allowed to go out for walks when their period of staying at home begins.

On Wednesday, the Osaka prefectural government in Japan said a woman working as a tour-bus guide had tested positive for the coronavirus for a second time. This followed reports in China that discharged patients throughout the country were testing positive after their release from the hospital.
An official at China‚Äôs National Health Commission said on Friday that such patients have not been found to be infectious.
Experts say there are several ways discharged patients could fall ill with the virus again. Convalescing patients might not build up enough antibodies to develop immunity to SARS-CoV-2, and are being infected again. The virus also could be ‚Äúbiphasic‚Äù, meaning it lies dormant before creating new symptoms.
But some of the first cases of ‚Äúreinfection‚Äù in China have been attributed to testing discrepancies.
On Feb. 21, a discharged patient in the southwestern Chinese city of Chengdu was readmitted 10 days after being discharged when a follow-up test came back positive.
Lei Xuezhong, the deputy director of the infectious diseases center at the West China Hospital, told People‚Äôs Daily that hospitals were testing nose and throat samples when deciding whether patients should be discharged, but new tests were finding the virus in the lower respiratory tract.
Paul Hunter, a professor of medicine at Britain‚Äôs University of East Anglia who has been closely following the outbreak, told Reuters that although the patient in Osaka could have relapsed, it is also possible that the virus was still being released into her system from the initial infection, and she wasn‚Äôt tested properly before she was discharged.
The woman first tested positive in late January and was discharged from the hospital on Feb. 1, leading some experts to speculate that it was biphasic, like anthrax.
A Journal of the American Medical Association study of four infected medical personnel treated in Wuhan, the epicenter of the epidemic, said it was likely that some recovered patients would remain carriers even after meeting discharge criteria.
In China, for instance, patients must test negative, show no symptoms and have no abnormalities on X-rays before they are discharged.
Allen Cheng, professor of infectious diseases epidemiology at Monash University in Melbourne, said it wasn‚Äôt clear whether the patients were re-infected or had remained ‚Äúpersistently positive‚Äù after their symptoms disappeared. But he said the details of the Japan case suggested the patient had been reinfected.
Song Tie, vice director of the local disease control center in southern China‚Äôs Guangdong province, told a media briefing on Wednesday that as many as 14% of discharged patients in the province have tested positive again and had returned to hospitals for observation.
He said one good sign is that none of those patients appear to have infected anyone else.
‚ÄúFrom this understanding ... after someone has been infected by this kind of virus, he will produce antibodies, and after these antibodies are produced, he won‚Äôt be contagious,‚Äù he said.
Normally, convalescing patients will develop specific antibodies that render them immune to the virus that infected them, but reinfection is not impossible, said Adam Kamradt-Scott, a specialist in infectious diseases at the University of Sydney.
‚ÄúIn most cases though, because their body has developed an immune response to the first infection, the second infection is usually less severe,‚Äù Kamradt-Scott said.
Other experts have also raised the possibility of ‚Äúantibody-dependent enhancement‚Äù, which means exposure to viruses might make patients more at risk of further infections and worse symptoms.
China has so far discharged 36,117 patients, according to data from the National Health Commission released on Friday, which represents almost 46% of the total cases on the Chinese mainland. If the 14% rate of reinfection is accurate and remains consistent, it could pose a wider health risk.
‚ÄúI would say that it is less about if it is possible that re-infection can occur than how often it occurs,‚Äù Cheng said.","['David Stanway', 'Min Read']",2020-02-28 15:38:12

A Los Angeles digital healthcare company called Scanwell Health is seeking U.S. government clearance for a kit that lets users submit a scanned image of a blood test to doctors via their phones. Within a few hours, according to the company, the user will learn whether the blood contains antibodies for coronavirus.
""The entire testing process happens at home,"" says Scanwell Chief Medical Officer Jack Jeng, ""No specimen has to be shipped back.""
A positive test result means a patient has been exposed to COVID-19 at some point in the past and has developed antibodies to fight it.
""The Scanwell rapid serology test is looking for antibodies in the blood. A positive test result means that you were exposed to the virus previously because it takes time for the antibodies to develop,"" said Jeng.
David Kroll, a professor of pharmacology at the University of Colorado who has worked on antibody testing, explained that the antibodies mean ""your immune system [has] remembered the virus to the point that it makes these antibodies that could inactivate any future viral infections.""
What the test can't do is tell you whether you're currently sick with coronavirus, whether you're contagious, whether you're fully immune ‚Äî and whether you're safe to go back out in public.
Because the test can‚Äôt be used as a diagnostic test, it would need to be combined with other information to determine if a person is sick with COVID-19.
""However, when combined with symptoms consistent with COVID-19 like a fever, cough, and sore throat, a positive test is pretty much diagnostic for the illness,"" said Jeng, ""That is how these rapid serology tests are being used in China.""
Scanwell's serological test is not a treatment. Other companies are developing antibody treatments in which blood plasma of people who've recovered from COVID-19 is used to treat sick patients with the virus.
Other companies, including LabCorp and Quest, are also developing tests to detect antibodies, but those are intended for hospital and lab use. On Thursday, the FDA issued its first Emergency Use Authorization for a rapid antibody blood test developed by Cellex for use in laboratories.
The Scanwell test is also different from the diagnostic throat and nasal swab tests for coronavirus that are currently in use. Known as PCR tests, they detect the virus's genetic material. ""The serological test is more of a history book, it tells you whether a person has been exposed to the virus,"" says Kroll.

The test kits are manufactured by Innovita, a Beijing biotech company, that has an exclusive three-year U.S. partnership with Scanwell. Innovita, which Jeng says has the capacity to produce 500,000 kits a day, has distributed tests in China, Iran, and the Czech Republic.
The tests have been approved by the Chinese version of the Food and Drug Administration, but for use in the U.S. they will have to cleared by the FDA. Scanwell has applied to the FDA for Emergency Use Authorization, and the earliest the approval would come would likely be two months from now, according to Jeng.
How the tests work
Once a doctor from Scanwell partner telehealth company Lemonaid determines a patient's eligibility for the test, the test kit is sent via next business day delivery to the patient's home, said Jeng. The patient places the blood droplet on a test cassette. After 15 minutes, the results appear and the patient uploads an image to the Scanwell Health app. On the other end, a Lemonaid doctor or nurse practitioner will deliver the results in a few hours, said Jeng.
""If they are infected, by not leaving the house they are not exposing others to the infection,"" said Jeng. ""If they're not infected, they're not being exposed to others in a waiting room who may have the infection.""
Scanwell, which is best known for creating the first at-home smartphone-enabled UTI test cleared by the FDA, received its first shipment of 200 coronavirus test kits from Innovita last week and is expecting 10,000 more later this week. Labs across the country will begin testing the kits with blood from patients who've been confirmed to have COVID-19.
In response to the COVID-19 outbreak, Lemonaid and Scanwell are working together to develop and distribute a test for at-home use. Scanwell
Testing too soon
In the detection of the virus that causes COVID-19, timing is critical. A negative result may be negative simply because the immune system hasn't had time to develop antibodies.
""[If] you test too soon, you could be negative,"" said Elitza S. Theel, director of the Infectious Diseases Serology Lab at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. ""Most individuals become positive for these antibodies about 14 days or after symptom onset or infection.""
""If you're positive, you probably have some level of protective immunity. But frankly, we don't know how long that lasts at this point.""
As far as being contagious, Theel says for those who test positive for antibodies, ""[W]e cannot determine at this point based on a serology test whether or not you're infectious. If you're still symptomatic and early after your symptom onset, you may still very well be transmitting virus.""
""On the other hand, you know if you're 20, 30 days out, post symptom onset, you're no longer symptomatic and you're antibody positive, chances are then you're probably not transmitting virus.""
New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo is banking on antibody tests to identify individuals who've developed immunity to help restart the economy, ""That would be very important for us to know because then healthcare workers that could go back to work,"" said Cuomo, ""there are workers that could return back to the private sector.""

Kroll warned, however, that a positive test doesn't mean a quick return to the workplace. ""I do think it'll be part of our return to work,"" said Kroll. ""[But] we're not going to be stay at home one day and then the next day everybody's allowed to go out.""
Jeng himself has a conservative take about an immediate return to the workforce. He said antibody tests are only one piece of the diagnostic puzzle. ""Thinking that you're completely immune,"" he said, ""may put you at risk.""
Jeng is also an anesthesiologist at the University of California-San Francisco Medical Center. He often performs procedures like placing breathing tubing in patients, a very high risk procedure if that patient has the coronavirus.
""If I had antibodies, and I knew I had antibodies to the virus, I'm still going to wear my personal protective equipment,"" says Jeng, ""So I would volunteer to take care of our sickest and most high-risk patients. And I would not want my colleagues who do not have any antibodies to be the ones doing this kind of risky procedure.""
""Regardless of your immune status, you should still do the right thing and protect yourself,"" said Jeng.","['Aliza Nadi', 'Aliza Nadi Is An Investigative Producer For Nbc News.']",2020-04-04 11:42:00

expert reaction to the idea of immunity passports
Comments in response to journalists questions about the idea of ‚Äòimmunity passports‚Äô, as mooted in the No 10 pres conference on Wednesday 2nd April.
Dr Bharat Pankhania, Senior Clinical Lecturer, University of Exeter Medical School, said:
‚ÄúWith respect to immunity testing and the issuing of ‚Äúimmunity‚Äù certificates, I advise caution.
‚ÄúCOVID19 belongs to the same family of viruses as the common cold virus. Infections with the common cold virus do not produce strong immunity and the immunity is usually short lived, usually about 3 months. We do not yet know how long immunity to the COVID19 virus would last for. Thus, is it very important to take note of this and continue to maintain infection control measures, post-infection, while research is being done.
‚ÄúThere is some evidence from Japan that suggests some people may be able to get second infections from the COVID19 virus, but we cannot yet be sure how common this is. We need more research in this area.
‚ÄúThe test for presence of antibodies does not translate into the patient definitely now being immune to the COVID19 virus, that is a super massive leap of faith and we must exercise much caution in the language and information we are giving out to members of the public.
‚ÄúOf paramount importance is to continue with infection control precautions at all times, even after infection and it is important not to give out ambivalent messages.‚Äù
Prof Robert Dingwall, Professor of Sociology, Nottingham Trent University:
‚ÄúThe idea of ‚Äòcertificates of immunity‚Äô is superficially attractive but in reality fraught with problems.
‚ÄúThese could not function like the yellow fever vaccination certificate that I carry with my passport, which declares that I have received a thoroughly tested vaccine whose duration of effective immunity is well understood ‚Äì and which is accepted internationally.
‚ÄúFirst, the science is just not there and will not be quickly. Immunity is only established over a period of weeks after the infection, so there is a problem knowing when to test. The BBC is reporting that none of the self-test kits evaluated so far is capable of delivering sufficiently accurate results to be relied upon.
‚ÄúSecond, there is considerable scientific uncertainty about who will develop immunity and how long that will last for. The duration of protection can only be established with the passage of time. People being declared well today will have to be tracked for several months and up to a year before we have definite answers. If immunity only lasts for a few months, then testing will have to be repeated constantly: the certificate will really only establish a person‚Äôs status on a particular day.
‚ÄúThird, as a sociologist, I also recognize the risks of a black market in certificates and of the stigmatization of people who do not have them. We have enough social divisions in our society without adding another one.‚Äù

It was caused by a previously unknown coronavirus, the SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) ( 1 ). SARS-CoV spreads from animals to humans by a rapid adaptation and evolution process ( 2 , 3 ). A large number of closely related viruses are present in wildlife reservoir populations ( 4 ‚Äì 6 ). Therefore, due to cross-species transmission of the same or a similar coronavirus, SARS could recur. Immune protection against infection with other human coronaviruses, such as OC43 and 229E, is short-lived ( 7 ). To assess SARS patients‚Äô risk for future reinfection, we conducted a longitudinal study of immunity in convalescent patients.
The Study
Shanxi Province in China was 1 of the SARS epicenters during the 2002‚Äì03 outbreaks. For our study, serum samples were taken from patients in 7 designated SARS hospitals in the province during March‚ÄìAugust 2003. Follow-up serum samples were taken at 6 months, 1, 2, and 3 years after the onset of symptoms. A total of 176 cases that met the World Health Organization (WHO) SARS case definition (8) and had known transmission history were included in this study. The study was conducted as part of a national SARS control and prevention program; use of serum from human participants was approved by the Committee for SARS Control and Prevention, Department of Science and Technology, the People‚Äôs Republic of China.
Titers of serum antibodies to SARS-CoV were determined by using a commercially available ELISA kit (BJI-GBI Biotechnology, Beijing, China). The ELISA was based on an inactivated preparation of whole-virus lysate. The kit was the first commercial kit approved by the Chinese Food and Drug Administration for specific detection of SARS-CoV antibodies and has been widely used in several studies (9‚Äì11). Manufacturer‚Äôs instructions were followed without modification. Briefly, for every ELISA plate, 1 blank, 1 positive, and 2 negative controls were included. For detection of immunoglobulin G (IgG), a 1:10 dilution of testing serum (100 ŒºL) was added to antigen-coated wells, and the plate was incubated at 37oC for 30 min. Horseradish peroxide (HRP)‚Äìconjugated antihuman IgG (100 ŒºL) was then added for detection of bound antibodies. For detection of IgM, the incubation of primary antibodies was extended to 60 min, followed by detection with HRP-conjugated antihuman IgM. Optical density (OD) readings were deemed valid only when the negative control OD was <0.10 and the positive control was >0.50 on the same ELISA plate. The cutoff for IgG and IgM determination was defined as 0.13 and 0.11, respectively, plus OD of the negative control. When the OD of the negative control was <0.05, 0.05 was used for the calculation. In this study, the OD readings of negative controls from different testing were consistently <0.05, so the cutoff ODs for IgG and IgM were 0.18 and 0.16, respectively. Serum samples that had an OD greater than or equal to the cutoff value were considered positive. Weak positive samples (i.e., OD<2√ó cutoff value) were retested in duplicate on the same day; only reproducible positive results were included in the final analysis. All data were processed by using Excel version 7.0 (Microsoft Corp., Redmond, WA, USA) and SPSS software version 10 for Windows (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).
Among the cohort, 163 (92.61%) of 176 (œá2 = 200.11, p = 0.000002) were IgG positive, which indicated that most patients who met the WHO case definition were indeed infected with SARS-CoV. As shown in the Table, at ‚âà7 days after the onset of symptoms, the percentage who were IgG positive was ‚âà11.80%. This percentage continued to increase, reached 100% at 90 days, and remained largely unchanged up to 200 days. Furthermore, after 1 and 2 years 93.88% and 89.58% of patients, respectively, were IgG positive, which suggests that the immune responses were maintained in >90% of patients for 2 years. However, 3 years later, ‚âà50% of the convalescent population had no SARS-CoV‚Äìspecific IgG. The OD changes correlated with the changes to the IgG-positive percentage, although the rate of change varied. Both the OD readings (0.93) and positive percentages peaked at 90‚Äì120 days; however, the rate of reduction of the average OD readings was much faster, dropping by 22% (0.73) and 40% (0.54) at 1 and 2 years, respectively, after symptom onset ( ).
A similar observation was obtained for IgM trends in this same cohort. The percentage of patients who were IgM positive within the first 7 days was 21.4% and peaked at 76.2% after 21‚Äì30 days ( ). The patterns of IgM-positive percentage and average OD readings were similar; both peaked at 21‚Äì30 days. After 60 days, the average OD readings dropped to 0.167, close to the cutoff value of 0.160.

Among the cohort of patients with known transmission histories, we were able to obtain a complete collection of serum samples from 18 patients at 6 months, 1, 2, and 3 years. The IgG levels of these 18 patients were analyzed separately to obtain an IgG trend that more accurately represented convalescent SARS patients ( ). All 18 patients had positive IgG at 6 months and at 1 year (i.e., 100% positive); only 1 patient became IgG negative at 2 years. However, at 3 years, the positive percentage dropped to 55.56%. The reduction of OD values mimicked that of the positive percentage, again at a faster rate. The average OD readings dropped from 0.94 at 6 months to 0.64 at 1 year, which represents a reduction of 33.33%. The OD further dropped to 0.52 (45.83% reduction) by 2 years and to 0.25 by 3 years.","['Li-Ping Wu', 'Nai-Chang Wang', 'Yi-Hua Chang', 'Xiang-Yi Tian', 'Dan-Yu Na', 'Li-Yuan Zhang', 'Lei Zheng', 'Tao Lan', 'Lin-Fa Wang', 'Guo-Dong Liang']",

The coronavirus may be ‚Äúreactivating‚Äù in people who have been cured of the illness, according to Korea‚Äôs Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
About 51 patients classed as having been cured in South Korea have tested positive again, the CDC said in a briefing on Monday. Rather than being infected again, the virus may have been reactivated in these people, given they tested positive again shortly after being released from quarantine, said Jeong Eun-kyeong, director-general of the Korean CDC.
‚ÄúWhile we are putting more weight on reactivation as the possible cause, we are conducting a comprehensive study on this,‚Äù Jeong said. ‚ÄúThere have been many cases when a patient during treatment will test negative one day and positive another.‚Äù
A patient is deemed fully recovered when two tests conducted with a 24-hour interval show negative results.
The Korean CDC will conduct an epidemiological probe into the cases, Jeong said.
South Korea was one of the earliest countries to see a large-scale coronavirus outbreak, but the country has seen just 200 deaths and a falling new case tally since peaking at 1,189 on Feb. 29. One of the world‚Äôs most expansive testing programs and a tech-driven approach to tracing infections has seen Korea contain its epidemic without lockdowns or shuttering businesses.
Fear of re-infection in recovered patients is also growing in China, where the virus first emerged last December, after reports that some tested positive again -- and even died from the disease -- after supposedly recovering and leaving hospital. There‚Äôs little understanding of why this happens, although some believe that the problem may lie in inconsistencies in test results.

As of Wednesday, South Korea had 10,384 virus cases, with 6,776 released from hospital, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University and Bloomberg News.
Epidemiologists around the world are in a race to find out more about the virus that causes Covid-19. The pathogen‚Äôs rapid global spread has recently seen the focus shift to patients who contract the virus but display few or atypical symptoms. Korea has been at the forefront of tracking these cases, which are causing particular concern in China, where the epidemic is showing signs of coming under control.",['Kyunghee Park'],2020-04-09 04:25:07

The coronavirus pandemic is a global crisis, but it is also a moment that unites us, that reveals the strength of our community, the human capacity to be compassionate to each other and to work hard in the face of danger. In this video I describe what, to me, might be 7 levels of attack on our society and how we can fight back. For each level, I describe our pain, our challenge, and our hope for a positive future on the other side.

The COVID-19 pandemic saw its first three confirmed cases in the Czech Republic on 1 March 2020. On 12 March, the government declared a state of emergency, for the first time in the country's modern history for the area of the entire country. On 16 March, the country closed its borders, forbade the entry of foreigners and issued a nationwide curfew. While originally planned until 24 March, the measures were later extended until 1 April[3][4] and then again until the end of State of Emergency[5] which was extended by the Chamber of Deputies until 30 April 2020[6] and then again until 17 May 2020.
Some measures undertaken by Czech Republic differed in key aspects from other countries. A general curfew was in place between 16 March and 24 April, however it included generous exemptions, apart from usual essential shopping and going to/from work among many other also visiting relatives and movement in parks and open countryside.[7] A general closure of services and retail sale was in place from 14 March until 11 May, however all shops could conduct distance sales with delivery through makeshift takeaway window and gradual opening of selected shops started in several waves already from 24 March onwards.[8] Government didn't order closure of manufacturing plants, but many did so voluntarily during second half of March with Hyundai spearheading gradual reopening from 14 April.[9][10] Czech Republic was first[11] European country to make wearing of facemasks mandatory from 19 March onwards.[12] COVID-19 testing was made widely available with drive through locations from 14 March,[13] and from 27 March anyone with a fever, dry cough or shortness of breath being eligible for a free test.[14] From 13 April onwards, COVID-19 testing capacity significantly surpassed demand.[15] Contact tracing in the country included also voluntary disclosure of mobile phone position and debit card payments data for previous days and quaranting of identified contacts.[16] By 1 May 2020, altogether 257 COVID-19 related deaths were identified in the Czech Republic compared to 2,719 in similarly populous Sweden, which did not impose any lockdown.
Czech Republic started gradual easing of measures from 7 April 2020 onwards[5][17] with most restrictions being lifted by 11 May 2020.
Background [ edit ]
On 12 January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed that a novel coronavirus was the cause of a respiratory illness in a cluster of people in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China, which was reported to the WHO on 31 December 2019.[18][19]
The case fatality ratio for COVID-19 has been much lower than SARS of 2003,[20][21] but the transmission has been significantly greater, with a significant total death toll.[22][20]

10 March ‚Äì Positive cases were being identified in ever increasing number of regions.[32] The Czech Republic became one of the first[failed verification] countries in EU to close its schools.[33]
11 March ‚Äì A first patient with COVID-19 reached state that required an intensive care unit.[citation needed]
12 March ‚Äì The Czech government has declared a state of emergency for 30 days and adopted a number of measures (see policies section below).[34][35]
13 March ‚Äì Brno University Hospital (a COVID-19 testing center) was hacked, disrupting services.[36][37]
15 March ‚Äì Shortly before midnight, Prime Minister Andrej Babi≈° announced approval of the nationwide quarantine (see policies section below).
Week 12 (16 ‚Äì 22 March) [ edit ]
16 March ‚Äì Starting at midnight, an hour after the nationwide quarantine declaration was approved the previous day, nearly 11 million Czech residents were placed under quarantine (see policies section below).[3] The Czech Republic became one of the first[38] countries in the EU to completely close its borders (with exemptions including international freight transport, see policies section below).[3] First three people were reported recovered.[39]
18 March ‚Äì The Czech Republic became the first[11] 21 March ‚Äì Deliveries of protective gear purchased by Czech Government in China started: a heavy cargo plane Antonov An-124 provided through NATO Support and Procurement Agency brought 100 tons of masks, respirators and coronavirus tests from China, while a China Eastern plane brought seven million facemasks.[40] This helped to alleviate the shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE) in the Czech Republic. According to Security Information Service, the shortage happened after Chinese embassy conducted massive purchases of respirators available on Czech market during January and February and transferred them to China.[41]
22 March ‚Äì First death reported: a 95-year-old man.[42] While COVID-19 positive, at the time of death, the man was not at ICU and did not suffer from pneumonia that is a COVID-19 specific type of death. The man suffered from chronical heart issues and had also a pacemaker. The cause of death was formally established as a ""complete exhaustion of organism"".[43]

US$2.1 m) came out wrong when double-checked through standard testing.[44][45] It was later confirmed the cause was an incorrect use where the fast-test react to an immune response and are not suitable for new patient screenings.[46]
24 March ‚Äì A second death was reported: a 45-year-old man died after six days in a hospital in Hav√≠≈ôov. The patient was suffering from advanced cancer with metastases to multiple organs. The cause of death was established as multiple organ failure due to cancer but COVID-19 infection accelerated the patient's death.[47]
A third death was reported: a 71-year-old woman died in V≈°eobecn√° fakultn√≠ nemocnice in Prague. The woman suffered from the chronic obstructive pulmonary disease as well as other illnesses, so it wasn't immediately clear that she may be COVID-19 positive. Only after being hospitalised the woman informed doctors that her relative recently returned from Italy and was then tested for COVID-19. The woman was connected to a ventilator but died three days after start of hospitalisation.[48]
Apart from the Uber driver on ECMO, there were 19 other patients in hospitals in serious condition, all of them connected to ventilators.[48]

A sixth patient died at Thomayer Hospital. The 75-year-old patient suffered from diabetes and Parkinson's disease and also had advanced heart problems. The patient had been in the hospital since January and got infected while in post-operative care. After this patient tested positive for COVID-19, the hospital tested all 29 other patients in the same ward on 22 March, all negative. The test was repeated again on 25 March, this time with positive outcomes for 13 patients. Several of the hospital's staff had become infected earlier, probably while taking care of the Uber driver who would later become the first remdesivir receiver in the country. This patient was originally admitted with simple pneumonia without initial indication of COVID-19. Two of the infected nurses were hospitalised at the local pulmonary ward at the time of the sixth patient's death.[49][50]
The government was planning to evacuate Czechs from Australia and New Zealand by the end of the week. Hundreds of Czechs still remained abroad, mainly in Oceania and Southeast Asia.[49]
An Antonov An-124 provided through the NATO Support and Procurement Agency arrived again with 24 tons of medical products purchased by the Czech government in China. The shipment included 52,600 protective suits, 70,900 protective glasses, 250,000 gloves, 1,160,000 respirators and eight million masks. Further government purchased personal protection equipment shipments were planned for delivery with use of planes by the companies Smartwings and China Eastern, which were contracted for nine flights per week for six weeks in advance.[51]
Commuters 37,000 and 13,000 Czechs live in the Czech Republic and work in Germany and Austria respectively, large portion of that in healthcare.[52] Cross-border workers (known as pendlers) were originally exempted from the complete travel ban. As Germany and Austria gradually became major centers of COVID-19 outbreak, the Government started tightening up rules for commuters. By 26 March, Czechs commuting to work in Austria and Germany were required to remain in those countries for at least 21 days. Upon return, they would be quarantined for 14 days. Czechs working in health, social services, and emergency services abroad were not subject to the new rules.[53][54] The rules were eased from 14 April onwards (see policies section below). Districts bordering Germany and Austria gradually became major centers of COVID-19 outbreak in the Czech Republic. [55][56][57] Districts bordering Germany and Austria gradually became major centers of COVID-19 outbreak in the Czech Republic. Doma≈ælice District reached the highest number of COVID-19 positive persons relative to population size in the country. According to Vice-prime Minister Czech government avoided closing the commuter loophole because German and Austrian healthcare system in areas close to the border is dependent on Czech commuters and also because government feared it could lead Slovakia to close access to Slovak commuters working in Czech healthcare.
26 March ‚Äì A Taiwanese student in her twenties, who recently returned to Taiwan from the Czech Republic tested positive for coronavirus. She left the Czech Republic after 8 months in the country on 19 March 2020, announced symptoms (fever, diarrhoea) to Taiwanese authorities on 24 March and was diagnosed COVID-19 positive on 26 March 2020.[58] 34 patients were in severe condition.[59]
27 March ‚Äì Despite having been quarantined already for two weeks, at least six retirement homes were hit by the spread of the COVID-19 virus.[60] Authorities noted also the rising number of COVID-19 positive healthcare workers.[61] As the capacity for COVID-19 testing increased, authorities eased requirements for free testing. Anyone with a fever, dry cough or shortness of breath may be eligible for a free COVID-19 test.[14]
29 March ‚Äì Five people died. Among the victims was a 45-year-old nurse from Thomayer Hospital, an elderly woman from a senior home in Michle and an elderly woman from a senior home in B≈ôevnice. There were 227 patients in hospitals, 45 of them in severe condition.[62]
Week 14 (30 March ‚Äì 5 April) [ edit ]
30 March ‚Äì In South Moravia, testing of the so-called ""smart quarantine"" was started: local travel history of infected persons were to be tracked using data from mobile phones and bank cards. 300 military personnel were deployed to reinforce local health authority for the purpose of tracing patients' contacts and collecting samples. If this approach is deemed successful by the authorities for diminishing the pandemic, the ""smart quarantine"" method is planned to replace the existing nationwide curfew policy.[63] The city of Uhersk√Ω Brod started thorough disinfection of all common areas of apartment buildings and public areas after a significant increase in COVID-19 infections. Health authority registered thirty new cases in the town.[64]
31 March ‚Äì In a community of 72 people living in a retirement home in Litomƒõ≈ôice, 52 positive tests were confirmed.[65] Employees of the retirement home in ƒåesk√° Kamenice decided to stay with their clients 24 hours a day until 15 April, to avoid the seniors getting COVID-19.[66]
1 April ‚Äì One month ago the Czech Republic reported the first coronavirus case. A second senior from the Litomƒõ≈ôice retirement home died, as well as seniors from Prague and Moravia-Silesia.[67] The Department of Infectious Diseases of the Central Military Hospital in Prague has treated COVID-19 patients with hydroxychloroquine. Eight of them have already been released for home quarantine. The evaluation of preliminary results of this therapy will be carried out in April. Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine were originally used to treat malaria, but at present they also help patients with autoimmune diseases‚Äîrheumatoid arthritis or systemic lupus. The World Health Organization (WHO) considers these substances as one of the options to treat COVID-19.[68]

2 April ‚Äì One victim died at the General University Hospital in Prague (VFN); another victim was a 79-year-old patient hospitalised at the Hradec Kr√°lov√© University Hospital.[81] The government decided to extend the border control by 20 days. Border checks with Germany and Austria will last until midnight Friday, 24 April.[82]
3 April ‚Äì A public controversy has arisen around shipments of personal protective equipment that the Czech Government purchased and airlifted from China. On 31 March, Mayor of Prague Zdenƒõk H≈ôib publicly praised Government of Taiwan for donating ICU ventilators to the Czech Republic, while pointing out that all of the equipment from China was purchased, none was donated. Representatives of China's business interest in the Czech Republic countered by claiming that China donated personal protective equipment that was to be handed over to Czech hospitals on 1 April. According the media, Czech authorities received a promise of donation of PPE, however none have reached the country by 3 April 2020.[83]
4 April ‚Äì There were 29 infected police officers in the Czech Republic, 343 more were in preventative quarantine.[84]
Week 15 (6 ‚Äì 12 April) [ edit ]
6 April ‚Äì Government eased a number of restrictive measures, e.g. by opening outside sporting grounds (including skiing, shooting ranges, etc.), movement in parks and nature without facemasks and opening of more shops and services (see policies section below).
7 April ‚Äì Government sought extension of the State of Emergency for 30 days, i.e. until 12 May 2020. Chamber of Deputies of Parliament granted extension until 30 April 2020.[85]
12 April ‚Äì Government announced that it was preparing a plan for gradual lifting of remaining restrictions. Government aimed at reaching maximum of 400 newly infected people a day in order to prevent overburdening the healthcare system. Instead of general restrictions, the intended maximum number should be reached through contact tracing of positive cases (see policies section below).[86]
Week 16 (13 ‚Äì 19 April) [ edit ]
13 April ‚Äì Number of COVID-19 tests sank from 8,000 a day to mere 3,200 a day during Easter weekend which included also Friday and Monday as state holiday. According to health authority, testing capacity during Easter weekend significantly surpassed demand for testing from potential patients. Health authority expected the demand to rise again in the following week.[15]
14 April ‚Äì A month-long complete border closure ended (see policies section below). A large number of Czech Romanis started returning from particularly hit United Kingdom, where many lived for over 15 years, leading to fear of possible increase of COVID-19 infection.[87][88]
Hyundai factory in No≈°ovice, which makes 1,500 cars a day including Kona Electric, restarted production after three weeks pause. Ten days later, Government exempted Korean Hyundai ""specialists and key workers"" needed for ramp up of electric vehicle production from cross-border and quarantine restrictions. Manufacturing plants were unaffected by Government restrictions, however many had decided to close voluntarily.[9][10]
The Czech government outlines a five-step plan for re-opening shops, restaurants and other businesses. Each subsequent step will be triggered as planned only if the previous step has not resulted in a total of 400 new COVID-19 patients per day.[89]
Infographic for the official re-opening plan (in Czech) as released by the Czech government
April 20: Farmers markets, tradesmen with shops, car shops and showrooms, outdoor athletic areas for professionals, without spectators, Weddings of up to 10 people following hygiene rules
April 27: Shops under 200 square meters in size, except for those in shopping centers over 5000 square meters and those specified to open at a later date.
May 11: Shops under 1000 square meters in size, except for those in shopping centers over 5000 square meters and those specified to open at a later date, Driving schools, Gyms and fitness centers (but not changing rooms or showers)
May 25: Outdoor areas of restaurants, cafes, pubs, buffets, wineries and beer shops with outdoor sales and garden seating areas, barbershops, hairdressers, nail salons, tanning salons, cosmetic salons, massage parlors, museums, galleries, and art halls, zoos (outdoor areas only)
June 8: All shops in shopping centers, shops over 1000 square meters in size outside of shopping centers, indoor areas of restaurants, cafes, pubs, buffets, wineries and beer shops, hotels and other accommodation providers (and their restaurants and cafes), taxi services, tattoo and piercing studios, theaters, castles, chateaux and other cultural activities according to the current regulations, mass events for a specified number of people, cultural, business, and sports events for less than 50 people, weddings following specific hygienic protocol, indoor areas of zoos
The aforementioned timeline was not kept as government significantly accelerated lifting of restrictions in the following weeks, with most being lifted by 11 May.
Week 17 (20 ‚Äì 26 April) [ edit ]
22 April 2020 - Prime Minister Andrej Babi≈° announced that the Government will not request the Chamber of Deputies of the Parliament to extend the State of Emergency beyond 30 April. Meanwhile, Minister of Interior announced that he will seek further discussion of the topic, claiming that State of Emergency is crucial for Government's ability to fast procure and distribute personal protection equipment outside of standard lawful procurement process.[90]
The court determined that the fact that measures were not adopted by the Government under the Crisis Act powers, but by Ministry of Health under the Protection of Public Health Act, leads to violation of constitutional guarantees of separation of powers. When adopting measures under the Crisis Act, the Government is continually under the supervision of the Chamber of Deputies of Parliament. Under Art 5(4) of the Constitutional Act on the Security of the Czech Republic, the Chamber of Deputies can revoke the State of Emergency at any moment. Thus taking away Government's power to adopt crisis measures under the Crisis Act, including those that violate basic rights. Adoption of the measures by Ministry of Health under the Act on Protection of Public Health frustrated this control by the Chamber of Deputies. In effect, the respondent impermissibly restricted constitutional powers of the Chamber of Deputies. Judgement of the Municipal Court in Prague No. 14 A 41/2020, section 152, from 23 April 2020[91]
23 April 2020 ‚Äì The Municipal Court in Prague invalidated some of the restrictions adopted in order to battle the COVID-19 spread. In particular, the court invalidated Ministry of Health Protection Measures that introduced curfew, banned hospital visits and banned selected retail sale and services. The court held that such wide restrictions of basic rights may be adopted only under the Crisis Act by the Government as whole and not under Protection of Public Health Act by the Ministry of Health alone. Both the curfew and retail sale ban were originally adopted by Government Resolutions on 14 and 15 March respectively, however then they were replaced by Ministry of Health Protection Measures from 24 March onwards. The court invalidated these measures from 27 April onwards, giving the Government three days to remedy the situation. The Ministry of Health may lodge an appeal to the Supreme Administrative Court. On the day of court's decision, there were suits against 17 other measures still pending.[92]
While Ministry of Health Protection Measures may be adopted indefinitely, Government Measures under Crisis Act may be adopted only for period of State of Emergency.[93] Government may declare State of Emergency for period of 30 days, any prolongation requires assent of the Chamber of Deputies.[94]
24 April 2020 ‚Äì In line with the decision of the Municipal Court of Prague, the Government announced that it would seek Chamber of Deputies' consent to extend the State of Emergency until 25 May. At the same time the Government announced a faster roadmap for the lifting of restrictions.[95]
Week 18 (27 April ‚Äì 3 May) [ edit ]
28 April - The Government sought an extension of the State of Emergency until 25 May 2020. The Chamber of Deputies of Parliament granted an extension until 17 May 2020.[96]
Week 19 (4 May ‚Äì 10 May) [ edit ]
6 May - The Ministry of Health presented the outcome of the COVID-19 prevalence study conducted over the previous weeks. Out of 26,549 people (volunteers and vulnerable groups with chronic deseases) tested for the presence of anti-bodies, the countrywide testing identified only 107 people with antibodies who were previously undetected. This showed a high success rate of contact tracing and quarantine measures and a very low rate of virus presence in the general population.[97]

Flattening the curve [ edit ]
flattening the curve‚Äîallows healthcare services to better manage the same volume of patients.[99] Inhibiting new infections to reduce the number of cases at any given time‚Äîknown as‚Äîallows healthcare services to better manage the same volume of patients.
The main priority of affected nations currently is to move to a slower doubling time of new cases, to ensure less crowded hospitals and therefore a lower case fatality rate.[100][101]
Governments of different countries take different approaches to flatten the epidemic curve. Beside travel bans and isolation of complete communities, citizens are also often requested to stay at home and keep social distance.[100]
Research indicates that measures must be applied rigorously and immediately to be effective. Also, the national community's commitment to supporting/tolerating the restrictions and following the advice of health authorities plays an important role in the success of flattening the epidemic curve and limiting the spread of the virus.[102][103]
For example, in South Korea mass testing efforts were successful. The South Korean national testing capacity reached 15,000 tests per day. Compared to population size, the Czech Republic reached the same rate of testing on 23 March 2020. The Ministry of Interior in South Korea also rolled out a smartphone app that can track the quarantined and collect data on symptoms, so scientists are able to see more epidemiological data.[104]
Curve comparison [ edit ]
Comparing cumulative numbers of confirmed cases in selected countries, including the Czech Republic, shows the different curves of the epidemic in different countries.[105][106] The chart shows the number of known cases and the pace at which the number increases on a logarithmic scale. The actual number of people infected may be and likely is, significantly higher, as only cases where the virus was confirmed by laboratory testing are shown. Many cases may only have an asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic course of the disease and never seek treatment. In yet others, the infection may still be in the incubation period, when it is asymptomatic and may not yet be detectable even by testing.[107]

Basic reproduction number [ edit ]
In epidemiology, the basic reproduction number (sometimes called basic reproductive ratio, or incorrectly basic reproductive rate, and denoted R 0 , pronounced R nought or R zero[109]) of infection can be thought of as the expected number of cases directly generated by one case in a population where all individuals are susceptible to infection.[110] The definition describes the state where no other individuals are infected or immunised (naturally or through vaccination).[citation needed]
The higher the R ratio number, the faster the disease spreads. If R is less than one, the reproduction within the population decreases.[111][112]
Development of R ratio in the Czech Republic
Development of new cases ratio in the Czech Republic
During the second half of March 2020 the progress of the pandemic in the Czech Republic showed a decrease in the R 0 ratio from the value above 2.0 down to the value 1.5 or below. The day-to-day ratio of the total number of cases decreased in a similar way, falling below 10 percent at the end of March.
On 1 April, the Director of the Institute of Health Information and Statistics announced that the R 0 number ranged from 0.87 to 1.33 with the most likely value of 1.1.[113][114]
Spread of the virus [ edit ]
During the spring holiday period between early February and middle of March 2020, an estimation of 16,500 Czechs traveled to Italy.[115]

Policies to fight the contagion [ edit ]
Interpersonal solidarity [ edit ]
Demonstration of making facemasks without sewing
The COVID-19 pandemic in the Czech Republic has created a wave of solidarity in a variety of areas, including:
Due to the lack of protective face-masks, volunteers sewed masks for other people and also shared instruction videos online. [245]
Programmes were launched to help the most vulnerable groups and seniors, on a non-commercial basis, by buying food and medicines. [246]
On Monday, 23 March, Czech National Television launched a temporary new television channel ƒåT3, which is to bring practical advice, news and a selection of ƒåT's classic programmes from the archive for older people. [247]
The Vietnamese community in the √öst√≠ nad Labem region raised CZK 140,000 for a donation of a ventilator to a hospital in √öst√≠ nad Labem [248]
Due to the closure of Czech schools, Czech National Television launched an educational programme for home education. The ""Uƒç√≠Telka"" programme is focusing on teaching first-grade pupils. The programmes ""Odpoledka"" on teaching second-grade pupils and programme ""≈†kola doma"" for ninth grade pupils preparing them for entrance exams to secondary schools. [249]
Czech manufacturer of 3D printers Prusa Research contributed to the ""free use project"" of shared Bicycles company Rekola to enable access to transport with a lower risk of virus transmission than public transport. [250] Prusa Research also designed, produced and distributed protective face shields for medical professionals. [251]
Prusa Research also designed, produced and distributed protective face shields for medical professionals. The ≈Ωuf√°nek family distillery from Bor≈°ice will produce and distribute for free disinfectant gels without the necessary permit from the health and agriculture department.[252]

Czech citizens have mobilised in a national effort to make and distribute home-made masks after the government decreed face-wear mandatory for everyone in an effort to combat the coronavirus pandemic.
The government, led by the prime minister, Andrej Babi≈°, has trumpeted mask-wearing as vital in controlling the spread of the virus and has urged other governments to follow suit.
The Czech Republic and neighbouring Slovakia are the only two countries in Europe to impose mandatory mask-wearing, the supposed benefits of which ‚Äì although endorsed by the World Health Organization ‚Äì are disputed by some.
The arguments in favour are explained in a government-sponsored video that features an appearance by the Czech health minister. Adam Vojtƒõch.
‚ÄúThe Czech Republic is one of the few in Europe that has significantly slowed down the spread of the virus,‚Äù the narrator says. ‚ÄúThe main difference is that everyone who has to leave their house has to wear a mask.‚Äù
In an effort to set a public example, Babi≈° and other politicians have addressed parliament and made national television appearances wearing masks.
But rather than provide the masks itself, the government has relied on the initiative of ordinary Czechs to ensure compliance with a rule issued days after a general emergency was declared that sealed the central European country‚Äôs borders and closed all but essential shops and services ‚Äì a move that transformed the tourist hub of Prague into a virtual ghost town.
Pharmacies have put up signs declaring that they do not provide specially made surgical masks, which are already in short supply for health professionals.
Fashion students at Umprum Academy of Art, Architecture and Design in Prague were spurred into action after a plea was posted on Facebook for masks for one of the city‚Äôs biggest maternity hospitals, Podoli.
‚ÄúThe students are making hundreds and hundreds of masks,‚Äù said Alice Klouzkova, an assistant and teacher at the academy‚Äôs fashion design studio. ‚ÄúMost of them have sewing machines at home and are happy to work with their hands. It‚Äôs important that the material is made with 100% cotton so it can be sterilised.‚Äù
One website, Damerousky.cz, offers an interactive map for those offering or looking for masks, while a collecting point has been set up at Prague city hall and other municipalities to distribute masks to vulnerable groups.
The effort has been almost universally embraced ‚Äì although there have been instances of people lowering their masks in public parks to smoke, or to drink beer outside the few pubs still serving takeaway beer.
Some have flouted the rule in less conventional ways. Police reported sunbathers at a nudist spot outside Prague failing to comply with the rule, while ignoring a separate ordnance forbidding gatherings of more than two people.
The initiative‚Äôs popularity prompted Babi≈° on Sunday to urge Donald Trump on Twitter to adopt a similar approach in the US. ‚ÄúMr. President @realDonaldTrump, try tackling virus the Czech way. Wearing a simple cloth mask, decreases the spread of the virus by 80 %! Czech Republic has made it OBLIGATORY for its citizens to wear a mask in the public. Pls retweet. God bless America!‚Äù
That in turn triggered criticism that the government imposed the rule without taking steps to provide masks. ‚ÄúYou made it obligatory (like Taiwan) but didn‚Äôt provide us with a single mask (unlike Taiwan), so we were obliged to sew our own,‚Äù one tweet said in response.
As of 29 March, 2,829 Covid-19 cases had been recorded in the Czech Republic, resulting in 16 deaths, with 40,700 tests having been conducted.",['Robert Tait'],2020-03-30 15:29:12

Some of these measures impose severe restrictions on people‚Äôs freedoms, including to their privacy and other human rights. Unprecedented levels of surveillance, data exploitation, and misinformation are being tested across the world.
Many of those measures are based on extraordinary powers, only to be used temporarily in emergencies. Others use exemptions in data protection laws to share data.
Some may be effective and based on advice from epidemiologists, others will not be. But all of them must be temporary, necessary, and proportionate.
It is essential to keep track of them. When the pandemic is over, such extraordinary measures must be put to an end and held to account.
This page will be updated as measures are reported.

We've now updated our data with several new indicators. The CSV download reflects this and version two of the API is now live. Please read what changed.
Systematic information on which governments have taken which measures, and when, can help decision-makers and citizens understand the robustness of governmental responses in a consistent way, aiding efforts to fight the pandemic. The Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT) systematically collects information on several different common policy responses governments have taken, scores the stringency of such measures, and aggregates these scores into a common Stringency Index.
Data is collected from public sources by a team of over one hundred Oxford University students and staff from every part of the world.
Stringency Index
OxCGRT collects publicly available information on 17 indicators of government responses. Eight of the policy indicators (C1-C8) record information on containment and closure policies, such as school closures and restrictions in movement. Four of the indicators (E1-E4) record economic policies, such as income support to citizens or provision of foreign aid, and five indicators (H1-H5) record health system policies such as the COVID-19 testing regime or emergency investments into healthcare. Read the working paper for a full description of the data and how it is collected, and see our codebook on GitHub for the most up-to-date description of indicators.
We‚Äôve also looked at what the data tells us about countries‚Äô readiness to exit lockdown and how closely they meet WHO guidelines in this research note.
The tracker aggregates the policy scores (not the financial scores) into a common ‚ÄòStringency Index‚Äô. Note that this index simply records the number and strictness of government policies, and should not be interpreted as ‚Äòscoring‚Äô the appropriateness or effectiveness of a country‚Äôs response. A higher position in the Stringency Index does not necessarily mean that a country's response is ‚Äòbetter‚Äô than others lower on the index.
Data
You can access the full dataset using our API or download a CSV of the latest data. Our codebook on Github explains the definitions for each variable. The data is also available in timeseries form and you can read about our calculation of the Stringency Index. These CSVs are also posted to GitHub, where we have additional notes and guidance on data quality for people exploring the underlying dataset.

Kay Ivey had resisted a statewide order, saying that she wanted to balance the health of the state's residents with the health of the economy. ""We are not California,"" she said on a conference call with reporters, according to AL.com. But after Birmingham, the largest city in the state, issued a shelter-in-place order for its residents, and amid growing pressure, the governor issued a statewide order. ‚ÄúYou need to understand we are past urging people to stay at home,"" she said. ""It is now the law.‚Äù Stay at home
Alaska About 737,000 people ""We crossed a line today,"" Gov. Mike Dunleavy said, issuing instructions for people to stay home or remain six feet or more from one another when outside. The mayor of Anchorage had previously asked residents to ""hunker down."" Stay at home

California About 39.6 million people California, America‚Äôs most populous state, was the first to order all residents to stay home.

Colorado About 5.7 million people A number of counties and cities in the state, including Denver and Boulder, had issued their own stay-at-home orders, but Gov. Jared Polis also issued a statewide order, reiterating the need for everyone to stay at home. ‚ÄúWe owe it to ourselves and our fellow Americans in order to save lives,‚Äù he said. Stay at home

Florida About 21.5 million people Gov. Ron DeSantis, who for weeks resisted more stringent statewide measures even as cities and counties took action, announced that he would order the state‚Äôs more than 21 million residents to largely stay at home. The governor said he started coming around to the necessity of a statewide order once the White House extended national guidelines to combat the coronavirus until April 30. ‚ÄúTo me, that was, ‚ÄôPeople aren‚Äôt just going to back to work,‚Äô‚Äù Mr. DeSantis said at a news conference in Tallahassee, the state capital. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a national pause button.‚Äù Stay at home
Georgia About 10.6 million people Gov. Brian Kemp announced that he would issue a statewide order for all residents to shelter in place, following a similar stay-at-home order in Atlanta and other areas. He said he made the decision, in part, after learning that many people without symptoms are transmitting the virus. ""At this point,"" he said, ""I think it's the right thing to do."" Shelter in place
Hawaii About 1.4 million people As in other states, there are exceptions to the stay-at-home order in Hawaii, including leaving the house to go surfing and swimming. But the governor's office said violations could be punishable by a fine of up to $5,000, or as much as one year in jail. ‚ÄúThe threat of COVID-19 is unprecedented and requires aggressive action,"" Gov. David Ige said. Stay at home
Idaho About 1.8 million people ‚ÄúOur health care and public safety workers are putting themselves in harm‚Äôs way to respond to the coronavirus emergency, and we owe it to them to do our part by following this statewide stay-home order,‚Äù Gov. Brad Little said. Stay at home

""While I left these decisions to local health departments as long as possible,"" she said, ""the reality is that the patchwork approach that has developed is inconsistent and is a recipe for chaos."" Stay at home
Kentucky About 4.5 million people Gov. Andy Beshear ordered all non-essential businesses to stop operating in-person services by March 26 and urged residents to stay ""healthy at home."" In a news conference on March 27, he clarified that the state's campaign amounted to telling residents to stay home. ""That doesn't mean you need to cower down in your home,"" he said. But ""you stay at home, unless you are getting groceries or other supplies that you may need."" Healthy at home

Because saving lives will depend on us.‚Äù Stay at home
Maryland About 6 million people Citing a drastic uptick in cases and deaths in Maryland and the United States, Gov. Larry Hogan issued a statewide stay-at-home order. ""We are no longer asking or suggesting that Marylanders stay home,"" he said. ""We are directing them to do so."" Stay at home
Massachusetts About 6.9 million people Gov. Charlie Baker stopped short of declaring a formal order, but announced an advisory for residents to stay home. ‚ÄúI do not believe I can or should order U.S. citizens to be confined to their home for days on end,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt make sense from a public health point of view, and it‚Äôs not realistic.‚Äù Stay at home advisory
Michigan About 10 million people ‚ÄúWithout a comprehensive national strategy, we, the states, must take action,‚Äù Gov. Gretchen Whitmer said, urging residents to stay home. Stay at home

New York About 19.5 million people Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo has shied away from the language of a shelter-in-place order, which he said evoked images of shooter situations or nuclear war. ‚ÄúWords matter,‚Äù the governor said, instead describing it as putting all of New York on pause. ‚ÄúThis is the most drastic action we can take,‚Äù he said. Stay at home
North Carolina About 10.4 million people A number of cities and counties in North Carolina had already ordered their residents to stay home, but Gov. Roy Cooper made it official statewide.

Stay at home
Ohio About 11.7 million people Gov. Mike DeWine has been notably aggressive in his response to the coronavirus, and Ohio was among the first wave of states to adopt this measure. ‚ÄúWe haven‚Äôt faced an enemy like we are facing today in 102 years,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe are at war.‚Äù Stay at home
Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt has told older and vulnerable people across Oklahoma to stay home, but mayors in the state's major cities, including Oklahoma City, Tulsa and Norman, ordered all residents to do so. ""We want to leave no doubt,"" Mayor David Holt of Oklahoma City said. ""The safest course of action during this public health crisis is to stay home.""

Curfew
Rhode Island About 1.1 million people Gov.

South Carolina became the last state on the East Coast to issue such an order. Stay at home
Tennessee About 6.8 million people Residents in the Nashville and Memphis areas were already under instructions to stay at home as much as possible when Gov. Bill Lee issued statewide guidelines urging everyone to do so. ""We need you to do that to protect the lives of your neighbors,"" he said. Stay at home
Texas About 29 million people For weeks, Gov. Greg Abbott left it to local officials to impose the most restrictive orders. Millions of people in certain cities and counties were told to stay home, including in Harris County, which includes Houston; Dallas and Tarrant Counties in the Dallas-Fort Worth region; and Bexar County, which includes San Antonio.

Virginia About 8.5 million people Gov. Ralph Northam, who shut down schools and nonessential businesses and banned gatherings of more than 10 people, had said that issuing a stay-at-home order was a matter of semantics. But after seeing beaches and other public areas packed with people, he issued a formal order. ""It is clear more people still need to hear this basic message: Stay home."" Stay at home
Washington About 7.5 million people Gov. Jay Inslee tried begging people to stay at home in Washington State, which has among the worst outbreaks of the virus in the country. Then he made it mandatory. ‚ÄúThe fastest way to get back to normal is to hit this hard,‚Äù he said. Stay at home
West Virginia About 1.8 million people West Virginia was the last state to have a confirmed case of the virus, but Gov. Jim Justice quickly joined a chorus of other governors calling on residents to stay inside. ‚ÄúA stay-at-home order is not martial law,‚Äù he said, reminding residents that they could still leave their homes for food and outdoor activity. But he warned: ‚ÄúThe magnitude of this is unbelievable.‚Äù Stay at home
Wisconsin About 5.8 million people Gov. Tony Evers initially thought he would not have to issue such an order, but later changed his mind. ‚ÄúYou can still get out and walk the dogs ‚Äî it‚Äôs good exercise and it‚Äôs good for everyone‚Äôs mental health ‚Äî but please don‚Äôt take any other unnecessary trips,"" he said. ""Limit your travel to essential needs like going to the doctor, grabbing groceries or getting medication.‚Äù Stay at home","['Sarah Mervosh', 'Denise Lu', 'Vanessa Swales']",2020-03-24 02:05:48
